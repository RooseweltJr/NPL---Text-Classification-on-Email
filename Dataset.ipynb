It\\n (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\\n VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\\n variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\\n to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\\n \\n This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\\n with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\\n manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\\n what you think.\\n \\n DISCLAIMER\\n ----------\\n Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\\n other than one person\\'s opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\\n to a real lawyer.\\n \\n QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\n ---------------------\\n \\n 1)  What is RIPEM?\\n \\n  RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\\n  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\\n  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\\n  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\\n  the intended recipient.)\\n \\n  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n \\n 2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n \\n  RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\\n  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\\n  file:\\n \\n  #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n \\n  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n  RIPEM.\\n \\n  The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\\n  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\\n  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\\n  friend.\\n \\n  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\\n  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\\n  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\\n  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\\n \\n  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n  available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n \\n 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n \\n  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n  are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n \\n 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n \\n  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n  Emacs.\\n \\n  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n \\n 5)  What is RSA?\\n \\n  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\\n  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n  decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n  the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n \\n  Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\\n  the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\\n  MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient can\\n  use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n  must have come from the sender.\\n \\n  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\\n  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\\n \\n 6)  What is DES?\\n \\n  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n \\n  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n  recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n \\n  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\\n  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\\n  multiple encryption with DES.\\n \\n 7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\\n \\n  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n \\n  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n \\n 8)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n \\n  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n  that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n \\n  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n  None of them provide perfect security.\\n \\n 9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n \\n  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\\n  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\\n  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.\\n  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\\n  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\\n  same length, etc.\\n \\n 10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n \\n  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n  instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n \\n  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n \\n  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n  RFC 1321.\\n \\n 11)  What is PGP?\\n \\n  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n \\n  Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n \\n  - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n    a direct network connection.\\n \\n  - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\\n    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\\n    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\\n    PGP 2.0.)\\n \\n  - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\\n    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\\n    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\\n    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\\n    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\\n    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP\\'s original\\n    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\\n \\n    #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n    #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n    #contraband.  \\n \\n  - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\\n    in Europe and other places.\\n \\n  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n \\n  Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\\n  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\\n  shouldn\\'t be that way, and some people interpret various documents\\n  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\\n  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n \\n 12)  What about RPEM?\\n \\n  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\\n  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\\n \\n  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\\n  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\\n  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\\n  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\\n  challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n \\n  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n \\n 13)  What is MIME?\\n \\n  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\\n  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\\n  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\\n  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\\n  the matter.\\n \\n 14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n \\n  You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n  probably key distribution.\\n',\n",

RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\\n  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\\n  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\\n  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\\n \\n  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n \\n  The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\\n  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\\n \\n 2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n \\n  RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\\n  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\\n  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\\n  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\\n  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\\n  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\\n  README file that this law not be violated:\\n \\n  #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n \\n  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n  RIPEM.\\n \\n  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\\n  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\\n  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\\n  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\\n  distribute it.\\n \\n  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n  available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n \\n 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n \\n  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n  are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n \\n 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n \\n  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n  Emacs.\\n \\n  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n \\n 5)  What is RSA?\\n \\n  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\\n  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n  decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n \\n  Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\\n  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\\n  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\\n  (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\\n  sender\\'s private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\\n  authority, can use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm\\n  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\\n \\n  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\\n  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\\n  also may be in sci.crypt.\\n \\n 6)  What is DES?\\n \\n  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n \\n  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n  recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n \\n  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\\n  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\\n  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\\n  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\\n  interoperability.\\n \\n 7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n \\n  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n  instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n \\n  MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\\n  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\\n  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\\n  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\\n \\n  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n \\n  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n  RFC 1321.\\n \\n  There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\\n  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\\n  function will be used if this is accepted as true.\\n \\n 8)  What is PEM?\\n \\n  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\\n  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\\n  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n \\n  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n \\n 9)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n \\n  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n  that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n \\n  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\\n  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\\n  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\\n \\n 10)  Isn\\'t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\\n \\n  This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\\n  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\\n  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\\n  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\\n  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\\n  cryptography.\\n \\n  This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\\n  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\\n  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\\n  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\\n  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\\n  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\\n  compressed with a patented algorithm.)\\n \\n 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\\n \\n  RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\\n  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\\n  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\\n  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\\n \\n       Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\\n       (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\\n \\n       Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\\n       and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\\n \\n       Cryptographic Communications System and\\n       Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829\\n \\n       Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\\n       and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\\n \\n  PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\\n  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\\n  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\\n  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\\n  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\\n  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\\n  patents.\\n \\n  RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\\n  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\\n  author\\'s desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\\n  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\\n  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\\n  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\\n  code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\\n  award.\\n \\n 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n \\n  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\\n  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\\n  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\\n  those of lots of other people\\'s keys.  This does not mean your keys\\n  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\\n  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\\n \\n 13)  What is PGP?\\n \\n  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n \\n  A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n \\n  - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n    a direct network connection.\\n \\n  - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\\n    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\\n    compatible with anything other than itself.\\n \\n  - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\\n    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\\n    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\\n    patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\\n    either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n    (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\\n    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\\n    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\\n    it hasn\\'t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\\n    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User\\'s Guide:\\n \\n    #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n    #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n    #contraband.\\n \\n  - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\\n    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\\n \\n  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n  Unfortunately, it\\'s not distributed separately from the program,\\n  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\\n  liability concerns.\\n \\n 14)  What about RPEM?\\n \\n  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\\n  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\\n \\n  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\\n  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\\n  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n \\n  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n \\n 15)  What is MIME?\\n \\n  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\\n  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\\n  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\\n  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\\n  Internet documents exist on the matter.\\n \\n 16)  What is TIS/PEM?\\n \\n  Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\\n  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\\n  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\\n  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don\\'t know\\n  much more than that.\\n \\n 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n \\n  You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n  probably key distribution.\\n',\n",

It does not go into\\n great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\n of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\n general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\n It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\\n is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\n specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n \\n CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n ---------------------\\n \\n - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n   messages with your private key.\\n \\n   RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n \\n - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n   an attacker to claim to be you.\\n \\n   DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n   remain high.\\n \\n KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n ----------------------\\n \\n - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n \\n   The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don\\'t do that.  Run \\n   RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n   which nobody else has physical access to.\\n \\n - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n   allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n   the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n \\n   It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n   given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n   not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\\n   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n   RIPEM doesn\\'t have features for doing this as automatically as\\n   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n   authentication.\\n \\n PLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n ----------------\\n \\n - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n   to Alice which says \"OK, let\\'s do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\\n   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n   your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n   unknown message.\\n \\n   To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n   include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n   the utils directory.\\n \\n LOCAL ATTACKS\\n -------------\\n \\n - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n   the plaintext, depending how it\\'s stored.\\n \\n   In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n   passphrase.)\\n \\n   RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n   viruses, and so on.  However, there\\'s a very real trade-off between\\n   convenience and security here.\\n \\n   A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n   where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n   course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n \\n   Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you\\'ve just\\n   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n   cleartext password authentication.\\n \\n   I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n   with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n \\n UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n -------------------------\\n \\n - RIPEM\\'s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n   exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n   states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n   forwarding functions to work.\\n  \\n   Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will\\n   make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware\\n   of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography\\n   can never be greater than the security of the people using it.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt \\n FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify \\n magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some \\n information \"from the horse\\'s mouth\".\\n \\n (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\"clearing\") meant to \\n be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying \\n the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)\\n \\n From National Telecommunications and Information Systems \\n Security (NTISS) \"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation \\n Security Guidelines\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):\\n \\n ------\\n \\n \"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media\\n \\n Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, \\n cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the \\n entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be \\n cleared by applying a vendor\\'s formatting program that overwrites \\n each location with a given character.\\n \\n Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \\n at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \\n applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \\n location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \\n this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \\n some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \\n actually do this.\\n \\n Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \\n released for destruction; however, they should be marked and \\n controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \\n information ever recorded.\\n \\n 7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\\n \\n Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a \\n degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \\n that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\\n \\n If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \\n operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \\n employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \\n addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \\n then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \\n alternatively.\\n \\n When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \\n the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \\n alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \\n pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \\n degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \\n vendor\\'s facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \\n removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \\n destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \\n platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\\n \\n 7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\"\\n \\n [see DoD Computer Security Center, \"Department of Defense Magnetic \\n Remanence Security Guideline\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \\n ONLY]\\n \\n ------\\n \\n This and many other interesting documents (many that are more \\n informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \\n can be obtained (free) from:\\n \\n Executive Secretary\\n National Telecommunications and Informations\\n   Systems Security Committee\\n National Security Agency\\n Fort George G.

Helsingius?\\n \\n \\n * * *\\n \\n \\n IDENTITY\\n ========\\n \\n _____\\n <1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\\n \\n   Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\\n   determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\\n   most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\\n   login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\\n   for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\\n   this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\\n   and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\\n   forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\\n \\n   In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\\n   takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\\n   information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\\n   transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\\n   type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\\n   protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\\n   corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\\n   is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\\n   origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\\n   at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\\n   difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\\n   real machines and represent real transfer routes.\\n \\n _____\\n <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\\n \\n   The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\\n   privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\\n   computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\\n   afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\\n   identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\\n   possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\\n   computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\\n   potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\\n \\n   Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\\n   and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\\n   H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\\n   segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\\n   in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\\n   forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\\n   reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\\n \\n   However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\\n   its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\\n   harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\\n   finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\\n   occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\\n   shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\\n   prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\\n   evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\\n   about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\\n   based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\\n   connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\\n   exerting pressure for acceptance.\\n \\n   Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\\n   `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \\n   Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\\n   for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\\n   authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \\n   Many government functions and services are based on identification,\\n   and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\\n   many government organizations push toward stronger identification\\n   structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\\n \\n   The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\\n   proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\\n   many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\\n   global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\\n   adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\\n   literally be magnified exponentially.\\n \\n _____\\n <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\\n \\n   Your email address may contain information that influences people's\\n   perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\\n   from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\\n   company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\\n   initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\\n   the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\\n   are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\\n   order that new users are added to the system.\\n \\n   Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\\n   broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\\n   information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\\n   fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\\n   rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\\n   cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\\n   in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\\n   or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\\n   continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\\n   computer receiving mail.\\n \\n   Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\\n   inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\\n   information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\\n   geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\\n   to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\\n \\n   Common Suffixes\\n   ---------------\\n \\n   .us    United States\\n   .uk    United Kingdom\\n   .ca    Canada\\n   .fi    Finland\\n   .au    Australia\\n \\n   .edu   university or college\\n   .com   commercial organization\\n   .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\\n   .gov   government\\n   .mil   military site\\n  \\n _____\\n <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\\n \\n   One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\\n   way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\\n   postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\\n   find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\\n   mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\\n   be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\\n   may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\\n   time and patience of others so use them minimally.\\n \\n   One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\\n   internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\\n \\n     finger user@here.there.everywhere\\n \\n   This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\\n   named in the address for information on the user named.  The\\n   response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\\n   be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\\n \\n   - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\\n     incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\\n   \\n   - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\\n     could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\\n     utility may return this response in other situations.\\n   \\n   - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\\n     computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\\n     attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\\n     actual full names of users kept in a local database.\\n   \\n   At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\\n   system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\\n   considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\\n   user ID's to `crack' passwords.\\n \\n   More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \\n   More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\\n   is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\\n   as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\\n   them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\\n   what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\\n   careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\\n   internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\\n   amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\\n   identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\\n   the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\\n   by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\\n \\n _____\\n <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\\n \\n   Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\\n   on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\\n   fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\\n   frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \\n   Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\\n   identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \\n   sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\\n   not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\\n   identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\\n   multiple machines anywhere in the world.\\n \\n   Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\\n   that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\\n   be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\\n   individual.  \\n   \\n   - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\\n     either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\\n     in the From: line.\\n   \\n   - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\\n     they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \\n \\n   - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\\n     line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\\n     hackers.\\n     \\n   The status and path information prepended to messages by\\n   intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\\n   possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\\n   email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\\n   problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\\n   on the internet:\\n \\n   - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\\n     rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\\n     mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\\n     sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\\n     addresses and bouncing mail.\\n   \\n   - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\\n     and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\\n   \\n   - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\\n     crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\\n     in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \\n   \\n   - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\\n     they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\\n     the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\\n     interpretations at different sites.\\n   \\n   The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\\n   anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\\n   somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\\n   traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\\n   is email, comprising  millions of messages.\\n \\n _____\\n <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\\n \\n   Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\\n   and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\\n   community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\\n   However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\\n   of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\\n   in privacy.\\n \\n   Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\\n   and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\\n   in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\\n   information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\\n   (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\\n \\n \\n PRIVACY\\n =======\\n \\n _____\\n <2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\\n \\n   Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\\n   perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\\n   mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\\n   data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\\n   not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \\n   others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\\n   without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\\n   limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\\n   consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\\n   any privacy, some expect and demand it.\\n \\n _____\\n <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\\n \\n   This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\\n   passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\\n   granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\\n   Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\\n   illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\\n   by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\\n   prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\\n   rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\\n   governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\\n   internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\\n   legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\\n   frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\\n   centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\\n   discourages its regulation.\\n \\n _____\\n <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\\n \\n   - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\\n     access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\\n     Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\\n     sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\\n     these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\\n     with supposedly vast funding and resources.\\n   \\n   - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\\n     electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\\n     with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\\n     detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\\n     very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\\n     possible.\\n   \\n   - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\\n     and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\\n     'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\\n     troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\\n     prohibitive for casual use.\\n \\n   Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\\n   scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\\n   tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\\n   completely defused with the use of cryptography.\\n     \\n _____\\n <2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\\n \\n   By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\\n   reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \\n   First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\\n   system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\\n   guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\\n   surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\\n   system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\\n   access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\\n   others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\\n   without detection.\\n \\n   Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\\n   extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\\n   commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\\n   information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\\n    `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\\n   initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\\n   to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \\n   This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\\n   purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\\n   unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\\n   the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\\n   commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\\n   symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\\n   \\n   UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\\n   and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\\n   regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\\n   functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\\n   tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\\n   activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\\n   login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\\n   \\n   Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\\n   various reasons:\\n   \\n   - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\\n     someone else. \\n \\n   - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\\n     invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\\n     many weeks. \\n \\n   - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \\n \\n   - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\\n     otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\\n     record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\\n     ones.\\n \\n   - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\\n     ``X Windows (in)security''.\\n \\n   Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\\n   more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\\n   ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\\n   compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\\n \\n   - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\\n   - Make sure to logout always.\\n   - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\\n   - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\\n   - Avoid password references in email.\\n   - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\\n   - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\\n     considerate.\\n \\n   Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\\n   password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\\n   prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\\n   changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\\n   passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\\n   are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\\n   that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \\n   passwords.\\n \\n \\n   (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\\n   here.)\\n \\n _____\\n <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\\n \\n   The most important privacy considerations are related to file\\n   rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\\n   or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\\n   your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\\n   your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\\n   users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \\n   Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\\n   files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\\n   the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\\n   directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\\n   in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\\n   the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\\n  \\n   By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\\n   initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\\n   preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\\n   associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\\n   with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\\n   between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\\n \\n   Examples\\n   --------\\n \\n     traver.lance % ls -ld ~\\n     drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\\n \\n   Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\\n   directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\\n   rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\\n   directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\\n   execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\\n   directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\\n   subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\\n   subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\\n   anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\\n   can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\\n   is completely invisible to them.\\n \\n     traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n     -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n     traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\\n     traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n     -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n \\n   Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\\n   from `group' and `other'. \\n   \\n   Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\\n   of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\\n   and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\\n   suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\\n   is possible:\\n \\n     ls foo\\n \\n   These commands would fail independent of file rights:\\n   \\n     ls -l foo\\n     ls -l foo/file\\n     cat foo/file\\n     cd foo\\n \\n   If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\\n   possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\\n   readable file named `file':\\n   \\n     ls -l foo/file\\n     cat foo/file\\n     cd foo\\n   \\n   The following commands fail:\\n   \\n     ls foo\\n     ls -l foo\\n   \\n \\n   (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\\n \\n _____\\n <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\\n \\n   X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\\n   project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\\n   applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\\n   computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \\n   The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\\n   graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\\n   requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\\n   mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\\n   situations the client is an application program running on the same\\n   machine as the server.\\n \\n   The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\\n   of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\\n   server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\\n   dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\\n   security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\\n   associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\\n   sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\\n   the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\\n   no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\\n   Windows.\\n \\n   Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\\n   flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\\n   insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\\n   that display or read it electronically based on access to the\\n   device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\\n   from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\\n   because the security is completely based on machine addresses\\n   rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\\n   himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\\n   \\n   > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\\n   > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\\n   > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\\n   > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\\n   > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\\n   > mutual trust does not exist. \\n   \\n   With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\\n   naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\\n   evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\\n   +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\\n   authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\\n   the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\\n   momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\\n   cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\\n   the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\\n   on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\\n   breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\\n   inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\\n   security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\\n   Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \\n \\n   New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \\n   make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\\n   file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\\n   .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\\n   allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\\n   vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\\n   `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\\n   monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\\n   keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\\n   sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\\n   out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \\n   mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\\n   sites often update this software infrequently because installation\\n   is extremely complex.\\n \\n \\n   (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \\n   Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\\n   <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\\n \\n _____\\n <2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\\n \\n   By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\\n   almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\\n   Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\\n   characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\\n   computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\\n   to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\\n   being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\\n   universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\\n   of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\\n   are only recently being established that afford high priority to\\n   privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\\n   potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\\n \\n   - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\\n     system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\\n     local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\\n     such as a university. \\n   \\n   - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\\n     agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\\n     computer searches have still not been strongly established and\\n     tested legally.\\n \\n   - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\\n     their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\\n     incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\\n     other than the recipient.\\n \\n   - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\\n     mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\\n     overridden.\\n \\n   - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \\n     everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \\n     routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\\n \\n   Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\\n   avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\\n   its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\\n   may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\\n   nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\\n   policies.''\\n \\n _____\\n <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\\n \\n   As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\\n   certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\\n   certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\\n   generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \\n   This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\\n   and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\\n   many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\\n   virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\\n   restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\\n   are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\\n \\n   Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\\n   In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\\n   regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\\n   complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\\n   objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\\n   usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\\n   urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\\n   many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\\n   of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\\n   unpopular opinions.)\\n   \\n   System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\\n   'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\\n   Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\\n   the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\\n   their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\\n   wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\\n   message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\\n   annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\\n   jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\\n \\n   In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\\n   administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\\n   are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \\n   entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\\n   commonly associated with the following `abuses':\\n \\n   - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\\n   - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\\n   - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\\n     poster instead of citing the content of the message\\n   - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\\n   - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\\n     `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\\n     files\\n \\n   Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\\n   official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\\n   accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\\n   internet can be construed as representative of their parent\\n   organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\\n   an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\\n   organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\\n   involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\\n   staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\\n   guidelines:\\n \\n   - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\\n   - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\\n     communication.\\n   - Use a disclaimer.\\n   - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\\n   - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\\n     proprietary or `internal'.\\n \\n   The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\\n   (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\\n \\n   /pub/academic/banned.1991\\n   /pub/academic/banned.1992\\n   ---\\n     Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\\n     and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\\n \\n   /pub/academic/cases\\n   ---\\n     This is an on-line collection of information about specific\\n     computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\\n     description of the items in the directory.\\n \\n   /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\\n   ---\\n     Notes on university liability for Usenet.\\n \\n _____\\n <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\\n \\n   The public information of your identity and account is mostly\\n   available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \\n   \\n   - You have control over most of this information with the utility\\n     `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\\n     `passwd -f').\\n    \\n   - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\\n     copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \\n     \\n   - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\\n     'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\\n     \\n   - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\\n     \\n   - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\\n     in your home directory.\\n     \\n   Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\\n   and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\\n   change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \\n   You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\\n   someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\\n   login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\\n   physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\\n   online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\\n   the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\\n   a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\\n   little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\\n \\n   To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\\n   accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\\n   remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\\n   below.\\n \\n ______\\n <2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\\n \\n   The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\\n   job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\\n   between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\\n   universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\\n   managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\\n   `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\\n   strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\\n   extremely strict.\\n \\n   The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\\n   used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\\n   on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\\n   email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\\n   may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\\n   both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\\n   specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\\n   which can potentially be misused.\\n \\n ______\\n <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\\n \\n   For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\\n   expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\\n   parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\\n   Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\\n   prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\\n   other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\\n   guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\\n \\n   Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\\n   local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\\n   occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\\n   portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\\n   `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\\n   no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\\n   frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\\n \\n   From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\\n   unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\\n   are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\\n   material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\\n   USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\\n   complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\\n   significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\\n   traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\\n   entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\\n   `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\\n   \\n ______\\n <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\\n \\n   Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\\n   appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\\n   prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\\n   safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\\n   international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\\n   inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\\n   many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\\n   many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\\n   drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\\n   Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\\n   over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\\n   the internet.\\n   \\n   Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\\n   internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\\n   ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\\n   introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\\n   technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\\n   automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\\n \\n   The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\\n   (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\\n   effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\\n   agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\\n   that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\\n   (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\\n   technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\\n   increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\\n   of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\\n   less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\\n   cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\\n   unstoppable.\\n   \\n   To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\\n   communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\\n   goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\\n   secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\\n   with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\\n   mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\\n   of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\\n   particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\\n   foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\\n   years.\\n \\n \\n ANONYMITY\\n =========\\n \\n _____\\n <3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\\n \\n   Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\\n   ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\\n   this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\\n   identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\\n   reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\\n   A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\\n   one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\\n   wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\\n   others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\\n   `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\\n   `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\\n   wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\\n   message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\\n   individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\\n   service and hide all  signs of the association. \\n   \\n   All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\\n   tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\\n   mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \\n   Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\\n   to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \\n   Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\\n   always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\\n \\n _____\\n <3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\\n \\n   Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\\n   problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\\n   identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\\n   case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\\n   discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\\n   anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\\n \\n   One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\\n   that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\\n   employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\\n   and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\\n   `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\\n   or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\\n   retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\\n   is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\\n   anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\\n   independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\\n   departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\\n   crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\\n   Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\\n   assurances of anonymity.\\n \\n _____\\n <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\\n \\n   The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\\n   email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\\n   accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\\n   effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\\n   supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\\n   guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\\n   accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\\n   accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\\n \\n   Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\\n   anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\\n   contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\\n   New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\\n   much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\\n \\n _____\\n <3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\\n \\n   One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\\n   server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\\n   allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\\n   person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\\n   for the same person for different machine address email\\n   originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\\n   to the server containing the final destination. The server\\n   `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\\n   and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\\n   anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \\n   This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\\n   mentioned above.\\n \\n   Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\\n   from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\\n   required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\\n   Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\\n   a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\\n   characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\\n   (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \\n   PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\\n   currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\\n   they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\\n   The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \\n   Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \\n   Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\\n   responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\\n   although actually may be held liable regardless.\\n \\n   These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\\n   \\n   - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\\n     anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\\n     indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\\n     aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\\n     implemented yet.\\n \\n   - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\\n     conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\\n     use of cryptography for basic protection,.\\n \\n   - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\\n     under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\\n   \\n   - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\\n     that goes through them.\\n \\n   - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \\n \\n   - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\\n     operators are basically  network users who do not own the\\n     equipment and are accountable  to their own system\\n     administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\\n     to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\\n     regarding it as illicit use. \\n \\n   - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\\n     server operator by the user.\\n \\n   Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\\n   protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\\n   field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\\n   approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\\n   most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\\n   and logs of network port connection information may be retained\\n   that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\\n   is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\\n   administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\\n   request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\\n   more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\\n   happening occasionally but infrequently.\\n \\n   See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n \\n _____\\n <3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\\n \\n   Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\\n   posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\\n   capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\\n   test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\\n   misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\\n   sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\\n   anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \\n   See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\\n   before proceeding.\\n \\n   Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\\n   message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\\n   This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\\n   with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\\n   consequences can ensue.\\n \\n   See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n \\n _____\\n <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\\n \\n   As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\\n   to the general internet community, and these services should be\\n   used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\\n   infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\\n   completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\\n   troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\\n   are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \\n   \\n   - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\\n     return addresses. \\n   - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\\n     unaltered. \\n   - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\\n     to a remailer are common.\\n   - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\\n     allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\\n     address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\\n     the use of passwords.\\n   - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\\n   \\n   Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\\n   systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\\n   field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\\n   endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\\n   essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\\n   distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\\n   to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\\n   internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\\n   operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\\n   from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\\n   threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\\n   prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\\n   have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\\n   characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\\n   problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\\n   individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\\n   e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\\n   \\n _____\\n <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\\n \\n   New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\\n   safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\\n   routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\\n   can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\\n   anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\\n   before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\\n   links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\\n   compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\\n   more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\\n   could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\\n   (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\\n   would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\\n   tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\\n   \\n   The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\\n   highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\\n   to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\\n   feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\\n   disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\\n   `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\\n   may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\\n   distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\\n   in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\\n   charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \\n \\n   Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\\n   be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\\n   in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\\n   carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\\n   its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\\n   be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\\n   introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\\n   is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\\n   traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\\n   portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\\n   services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\\n   acceptance of Usenet.\\n \\n \\n * * *\\n \\n This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous\\n   FTP to pit-manager@mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or \\n   newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.\\n Written by L.

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\\n   (similar to today\\'s checking system except entirely digital) may\\n   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\\n   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\\n   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\\n   (~Dec.1992).\\n \\n   An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\\n   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\\n   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\\n   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\\n \\n     ::\\n     command: help\\n     \\n     user@host\\n \\n   where `user@host\\' is your email address.\\n  \\n   \\n _____\\n <5.2> What is a ``hacker\\'\\' or ``cracker\\'\\'?\\n \\n   These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\\n   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\\n   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\\n   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\\n   internet users prefer the term ``cracker\\'\\' for this.  Instead, a\\n   ``hacker\\'\\' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\\n   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\\n   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\\n   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\\n   the ``Hacker\\'s Dictionary\\'\\' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq\\'.\\n  \\n  \\n _____\\n <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk\\'\\'?\\n \\n   From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\\n \\n   > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\\n   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\\n   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\\n   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\\n   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\\n   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\\n   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\\n   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\\n   > their opinions.\\n \\n   See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\\n \\n   See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\\n   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\\n \\n _____\\n <5.4> What is `steganography\\' and anonymous pools?\\n \\n   Closely associated with encryption is `steganography\\' or the\\n   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\\n   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \\n   Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\\n   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\\n   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\\n   typically the most \\'noisy\\'. In addition, when such an item is\\n   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\\n   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\\n   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\\n   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\\n   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\\n   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\\n   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\\n   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\\n   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\\n   commands in the subject line:\\n \\n     subscribe\\n     unsubscribe\\n     help\\n \\n _____\\n <5.5> What is `security through obscurity\\'?\\n \\n   `Security through obscurity\\' refers to the attempt to gain\\n   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\\n   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\\n   public information on its software\\'s encryption techniques to evade\\n   `attacks\\' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\\n   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\\n   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\\n   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\\n   because they are ``not widely known\\'\\' or ``not widely used.\\'\\' This\\n   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\\n   posting `forgery\\'. `Security through obscurity\\' is regarded as a\\n   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\\n   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach\\'\\'). See the FAQ\\n   for alt.security.  \\n   \\n   Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\\n   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\\n   International Symposium on National Security & National\\n   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\\n \\n   > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\\n   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It\\'s\\n   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\\n   > something hits the Net and it\\'s something which people on there\\n   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\\n   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\\n   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\\n   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\\n   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\\n   > but you may differ...\\n \\n _____\\n <5.6> What are `identity daemons\\'?\\n   \\n   RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\\n   query a remote user\\'s login name after connection to a local\\n   communication socket (a connection of this type is established\\n   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\\n   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\\n   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\\n   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\\n   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\\n   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\\n \\n _____\\n <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\\n \\n \\n   Remailing/Posting\\n   -----------------\\n   \\n   - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\\n     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\\n   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\\n     postings.\\n   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\\n     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\\n     encrypted addresses, etc.)\\n   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\\n     remailer site chaining.\\n   \\n   General\\n   -------\\n   \\n   - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\\n     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\\n     general public and their governments.\\n   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \\n     by systems designers into\\n     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,\\'\\n     `seamlessly,\\' and `transparently\\'.\\n   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\\n     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\\n     agencies.\\n   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\\n     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\\n     strengthening and protecting it.\\n \\n \\n ISSUES\\n ======\\n \\n _____\\n <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\\n \\n   From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\\n \\n   > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\\n   > media which connect us.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\\n   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\\n   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\\n   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\\n   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\\n   NSA\\'s interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\\n   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\\n   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\\n   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\\n   caller identification.\\n \\n   CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\\n   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\\n   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.

The movement reached a\\n   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\\n   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\\n   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\\n  \\n   Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\\n   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\\n   pub/cypherpunks/hal\\'s.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\\n   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\\n   aid remailer use).\\n \\n   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\\n   -----------------------------\\n     Anonymized mail.

Liability issues\\n     are wholly unresolved.\\n   \\n   - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\\n     software (see the question on cryptography). \\n \\n   - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\\n     vary between sites.\\n \\n   - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\\n     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\\n \\n _____\\n <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\\n \\n   \\n   Users\\n   -----\\n \\n   - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\\n     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\\n   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\\n   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\\n     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\\n   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\\n     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\\n     network traffic.\\n   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\\n     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt\\'\\n     hierarchy is preferred.\\n   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\\n     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\\n     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\\n     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\\n     future ones under the same handle.\\n   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\\n     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\\n     sending anonymized mail to yourself.\\n   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \\n     Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\\n   - Be considerate and respectful of other\\'s objections to anonymity.\\n   - ``Hit-and-run\\'\\' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\\n     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\\n   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\\n     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\\n     his hardware, all for your convenience.\\n \\n   Operators\\n   ---------\\n \\n   - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\\n     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\\n     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\\n     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\\n     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\\n     lassaiz-faire?\\n   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\\n     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\\n     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\\n     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\\n     users trust you to protect them.\\n   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\\n     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\\n     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\\n     the account, \\'out\\' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\\n   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\\n     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\\n     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\\n     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\\n     ``(in)stability of anonymity\\'\\'.\\n   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\\n     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\\n     your commitment to it?\\n   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\\n     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \\n     Consult a lawyer about your liability.\\n   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\\n     to deal with complaints and `hate mail\\' addressed to you.  If you\\n     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\\n     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\\n   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\\n     possible, query group readers.\\n   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\\n     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\\n     the key text `Anon\\' is  somewhere in every header.\\n   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\\n     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\\n \\n   Readers\\n   -------\\n   \\n   - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\\n     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\\n     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\\n     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\\n     volume is heavy or increasing).\\n   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\\n     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\\n     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\\n   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\\n     harassment, extortion, etc.\\n   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\\n     offend you personally.\\n   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\\n     idea of anonymity itself.\\n   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\\n     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible\\' or\\n     `conceivable\\' need exists.\\n \\n   References\\n   ----------\\n   \\n   See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\\n \\n   > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\\n   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system\\n   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of\\n   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a\\n   > letter to the editor.

Not perfect and won\\'t\\n   > kill followups. \\n   \\n   Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\\n   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\\n   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\\n   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\\n   \\n _____\\n <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\\n \\n   Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\\n   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\\n   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\\n   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\\n   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\\n   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\\n   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\\n   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\\n   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\\n   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\\n   servers like there\\'s no tomorrow.\\'\\'\\n   \\n   Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax\\' and interested in\\n   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\\n   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\\n   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\\n   server to new, more `mainstream\\'  groups was starting to emerge,\\n   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\\n   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\\n   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\\n   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\\n   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.\\'\\' \\n   K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\\n   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\\n   against it. \\n \\n   K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher\\'\\' to\\n   `squelch\\' or `plonk\\' abusive users in response to complaints, and\\n   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\\n   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\\n   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\\n   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\\n   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\\n   created.\\'\\'\\n \\n   In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\\n   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\\n   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\\n   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\\n   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\\n   accessability in response to \\'lots\\' of international requests.\\n   \\n   J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\\n   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\\n   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\\n   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\\n   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\\n   ``routine\\'\\' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\\n   anonymity is also controversial.\\n \\n   For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\\n   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\\n   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\\n   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\\n   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\\n   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\\n   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\\n   vociferous outrage at the poster\\'s use of anonymity, reverberating\\n   through many newsgroups. \\n   \\n   The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\\n   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,\\'\\'\\n   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\\n   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\\n   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\\n   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\\n   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\\n   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\\n   detractors.\\n \\n   Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\\n   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\\n   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\\n   extingisher\\'\\' and the ``group bouncer\\'\\' mechanisms that limit the\\n   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\\n   best described as `inundated\\': it has registered over 13,000 users\\n   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\\n   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\\n   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\\n   to the capability for `global\\' anonymity which has allowed users to\\n   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\\n \\n   Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\\n   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\\n   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\\n   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\\n   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\\n   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\\n   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing\\' through it\\n   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\\n   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\\n   service\\'s administration. In response to the serious threats he\\n   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\\n   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\\n   \\n   Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\\n   ``cypherpunks,\\'\\' J. Helsingius has identified many security\\n   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\\n   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\\n   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\\n   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\\n   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\\n   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\\n   etc.\\n \\n   A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\\n   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\\n   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\\n   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\\n   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\\n   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\\n   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\\n   software to the public domain.\\n \\n   Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing\\' on\\n   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\\n   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\\n   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\\n   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\\n   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\\n   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\\n   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\\n   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\\n   encryption.\\n \\n   See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting\\'\\' below and ``what\\n   is going on with anon.penet.fi?\\'\\' in this document.\\n   \\n   (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\\n   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\\n   <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\\n   contributions here.)\\n \\n \\n _____\\n <8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\\n \\n   KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\\n     \\n   > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\\n   > content of one\\'s message.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n \\n Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n \\n A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n commercial use today.\\n \\n This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n \\n A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n \\n \\n                                 2\\n \\n \\n \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n wiretap.\\n \\n The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n new authorities to access the content of the private\\n conversations of Americans.\\n \\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n their findings.\\n \\n The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n \\n      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n \\n      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n           calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n \\n      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n           technology to build the National Information\\n           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n           the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n           marketplace; and \\n \\n      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n           high technology products.\\n \\n The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n \\n \\n \\n                                 3\\n \\n The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n system transmits voice.\\n \\n Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n them from those who break the law.\\n \\n Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n encryption technology are also available.  \\n \\n For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n \\n ---------------------------------\\n \\n \\n QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n \\n A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n      no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n      conversations of Americans.\\n \\n Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n      decipher the message?\\n \\n A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n      escrow system.\\n \\n Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n \\n A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n \\n Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n      how strong the security is?  \\n \\n A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n      potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n      vulnerabilities.\\n \\n Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n \\n A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n      officials.\\n \\n Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n \\n A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n      decisions related to this initiative.\\n \\n Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n \\n A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n      manufacturer that produces them.\\n \\n Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n \\n A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n      to other vendors in the future.\\n \\n Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n \\n A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n      \\n Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n      powerful encryption devices?\\n \\n A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n      developing.\\n \\n      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n \\n Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n \\n A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n      and terrorism.\\n \\n Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n      the government hardware?\\n \\n A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n      requirements.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n \\n Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n \\n A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n commercial use today.\\n \\n This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n \\n A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n \\n \\n                                 2\\n \\n \\n \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n wiretap.\\n \\n The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n new authorities to access the content of the private\\n conversations of Americans.\\n \\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n their findings.\\n \\n The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n \\n      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n \\n      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n           calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n \\n      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n           technology to build the National Information\\n           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n           the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n           marketplace; and \\n \\n      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n           high technology products.\\n \\n The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n \\n \\n \\n                                 3\\n \\n The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n system transmits voice.\\n \\n Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n them from those who break the law.\\n \\n Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n encryption technology are also available.  \\n \\n For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n \\n ---------------------------------\\n \\n \\n QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n \\n A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n      no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n      conversations of Americans.\\n \\n Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n      decipher the message?\\n \\n A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n      escrow system.\\n \\n Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n \\n A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n \\n Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n      how strong the security is?  \\n \\n A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n      potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n      vulnerabilities.\\n \\n Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n \\n A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n      officials.\\n \\n Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n \\n A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n      decisions related to this initiative.\\n \\n Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n \\n A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n      manufacturer that produces them.\\n \\n Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n \\n A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n      to other vendors in the future.\\n \\n Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n \\n A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n      \\n Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n      powerful encryption devices?\\n \\n A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n      developing.\\n \\n      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n \\n Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n \\n A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n      and terrorism.\\n \\n Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n      the government hardware?\\n \\n A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n      of these products.\\n \\n  \\n      \\n -- \\n \\tJim Gillogly\\n \\tTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01\\n',\n",

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n \\n Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n \\n A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n commercial use today.\\n \\n This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n \\n A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n \\n \\n                                 2\\n \\n \\n \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n wiretap.\\n \\n The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n new authorities to access the content of the private\\n conversations of Americans.\\n \\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n their findings.\\n \\n The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n \\n      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n \\n      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n           calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n \\n      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n           technology to build the National Information\\n           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n           the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n           marketplace; and \\n \\n      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n           high technology products.\\n \\n The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n \\n \\n \\n                                 3\\n \\n The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n system transmits voice.\\n \\n Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n them from those who break the law.\\n \\n Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n encryption technology are also available.  \\n \\n For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n \\n - - ---------------------------------\\n \\n \\n QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n \\n A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n      no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n      conversations of Americans.\\n \\n Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n      decipher the message?\\n \\n A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n      escrow system.\\n \\n Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n \\n A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n \\n Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n      how strong the security is?  \\n \\n A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n      potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n      vulnerabilities.\\n \\n Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n \\n A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n      officials.\\n \\n Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n \\n A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n      decisions related to this initiative.\\n \\n Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n \\n A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n      manufacturer that produces them.\\n \\n Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n \\n A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n      to other vendors in the future.\\n \\n Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n \\n A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n      \\n Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n      powerful encryption devices?\\n \\n A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n      developing.\\n \\n      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n \\n Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n \\n A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n      and terrorism.\\n \\n Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n      the government hardware?\\n \\n A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n      of these products.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n April 16, 1993\\n \\n INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n \\n The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\n cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\n millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\n comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\n export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\n robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n \\n However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\n reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\n public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\n Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\n equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\n National Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\n split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\n manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\n store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\n presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\n classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\n incorporation into its communications products.\\n \\n      This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n \\n First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\n inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\n product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\n Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\n the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\n should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n \\n Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\n Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\n believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\n public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\n open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n \\n Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\n prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\n needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\n adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\n Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\n Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\n of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\n answer.\\n \\n In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\n of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\n and security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\n considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\n discussion even begins.\\n \\n DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n \\n ESCROW\\n \\n The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\n hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\n would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\n agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n \\n Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\n have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\n the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\n asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\n have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\n Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\n but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n \\n CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n \\n The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\n the government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\n the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\n back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\n Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\n cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\n algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\n made public.\\n \\n The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\n secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\n firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\n about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n \\n GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n \\n In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\n in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\n for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\n Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\n briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\n private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\n no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n \\n COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n \\n The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\n inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\n and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\n controls on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\n Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\n National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\n Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\n in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n \\n FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n \\n Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\n Daniel J.

Sophisticated\\n encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\n exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\n activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\n been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\n electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\n enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\n protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\n encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\n innovative approaches.\\n \\n In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\n developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\n encryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\n government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\n to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\n will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\n only with appropriate legal authorization.\\n \\n To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\n and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\n information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n \\n INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n \\n The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\n shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\n incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\n key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\n enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\n the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\n ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\n microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\n hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\n security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\n not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\n government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\n are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\n escrow system.\\n \\n KEY-ESCROW\\n \\n The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\n entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\n installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\n holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\n unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\n to government agencies that have established their authority to\\n acquire the content of those communications that have been\\n encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\n General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\n an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\n communications.\\n \\n PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n \\n The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\n U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\n facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\n with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\n that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\n process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\n a final standard within six months of this directive. \\n \\n The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\n the extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\n lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\n law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\n shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\n Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n [An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\\n \\n                        April 16, 1993\\n \\n       INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \\n                            PROPOSAL\\n \\n        The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \\n on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \\n millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \\n comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \\n such as export controls which have effectively denied most people \\n easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \\n posed by new technology.\\n \\n        However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \\n already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \\n any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \\n Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \\n equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \\n by the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \\n 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \\n chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \\n agents would store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over \\n law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \\n encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \\n available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \\n communications products.\\n \\n        This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n \\n        First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \\n before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \\n not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \\n have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \\n government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\\n independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \\n based on open standards.\\n \\n        Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \\n Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \\n classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \\n and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \\n standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n \\n        Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \\n system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \\n law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \\n publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \\n safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \\n individual\\'s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \\n inquiries?  \\n \\n        In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \\n importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \\n digital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \\n ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \\n the discussion even begins.\\n \\n DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n \\n ESCROW\\n \\n The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \\n whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \\n warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \\n over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \\n will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \\n Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \\n agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \\n organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \\n yet.\\n \\n Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \\n communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \\n using it.\\n \\n CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n \\n The Administration claims that there are no back door means by \\n which the government or others could break the code without \\n securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \\n be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \\n to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \\n an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \\n arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \\n of the investigation would then be made public.\\n \\n GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n \\n In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \\n believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \\n customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \\n VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \\n \\n FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n \\n Jerry Berman, Executive Director\\n Daniel J.

       " '\\n \\n Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it\\'s worth noting that\\n the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only\\n used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\\n encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\\n standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\\n easy-to-break inverters.\\n \\n Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\\n Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\\n e-mail and files, let\\'s focus on this.\\n \\n One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\\n limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\\n \\n Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\\n less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\\n secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\\n eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\\n cordless phones.\\n \\n -------\\n \\n Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\\n without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\\n confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\\n security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\\n available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\\n \\n Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\\n have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\\n depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\\n escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\\n week, and that system has worked pretty well.\\n \\n From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\\n need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\\n return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\\n and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\\n skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\\n checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn\\'t have to\\n be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\\n pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\\n communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\\n eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\\n \\n ------\\n \\n In discussing this, let\\'s try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\\n noise of some previous threads.

The new cryptography scheme was \\n announced today by the White House and the National Institute \\n for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the \\n technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman \\n acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\\n secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the \\n encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\\n \\n \\tAccording to NIST, the technical specifications and the \\n Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To \\n open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today \\n filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests \\n with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security \\n Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption \\n plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the \\n Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to \\n open the development of non-military computer security standards \\n to public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of \\n such standards.\\n \\n \\tCPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in \\n developing the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a \\n communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for \\n government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA \\n lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first \\n time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  \\n NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying \\n the classification of records concerning its creation of the \\n DSS.\\n \\n \\tDavid Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the \\n administration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of \\n electronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official \\n statement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned \\n the propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent \\n secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from \\n public scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the \\n development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital \\n that standards designed to protect personal privacy be \\n established openly and with full public participation.  It is \\n not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of \\n secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to \\n play a leading role in the development process.\" \\n \\n \\tCPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer \\n industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of \\n technology on society.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n \\n    Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n \\n    A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n    commercial use today.\\n \\n    This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n \\n    A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n    \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n \\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\t   2\\n \\n \\n    \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n    in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n    wiretap.\\n \\n    The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n    new authorities to access the content of the private\\n    conversations of Americans.\\n \\n    To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n    government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n    their findings.\\n \\n    The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n    encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n    criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n    the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n \\n \\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n \\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n \\n \\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n \\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n \\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n \\n \\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n \\t     technology to build the National Information\\n \\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n \\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n \\t     marketplace; and \\n \\n \\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n \\t     high technology products.\\n \\n    The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\t   3\\n \\n    The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n    sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n    (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n    programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n    system transmits voice.\\n \\n    Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n    protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n    them from those who break the law.\\n \\n    Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n    The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n    encryption technology are also available.  \\n \\n    For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n    Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n \\n    ---------------------------------\\n \\n \\n    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n    TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n \\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n \\n    A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n \\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\\n \\tconversations of Americans.\\n \\n    Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n \\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n \\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n \\tdecipher the message?\\n \\n    A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n \\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n \\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\\n \\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n \\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n \\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n \\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n \\tescrow system.\\n \\n    Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n \\n    A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n \\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n \\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n \\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n \\n    Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n \\thow strong the security is?  \\n \\n    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n \\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n \\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n \\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n \\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n \\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\\n \\tvulnerabilities.\\n \\n    Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n \\n    A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n \\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n \\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n \\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n \\tofficials.\\n \\n    Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n \\n    A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n \\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n \\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n \\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n \\tdecisions related to this initiative.\\n \\n    Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n \\n    A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n \\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n \\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n \\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n \\tmanufacturer that produces them.\\n \\n    Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n \\n    A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n \\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n \\tmanufacturers.

The key escrow\\n \\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n \\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n \\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\\n \\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n \\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\\n \\tdeveloping.\\n \\n \\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n \\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n \\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n \\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n \\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n \\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n \\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n \\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n \\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n \\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n \\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n \\n    Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n \\tAdministration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n \\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \\n \\n    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n \\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n \\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\\n \\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n \\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n \\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n \\tand terrorism.\\n \\n    Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n \\tthe government hardware?\\n \\n    A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n \\trequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n \\trequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n \\tsame is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n \\tattractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n \\tto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n \\tin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n \\tcase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n \\tdevices to secure their own communications abroad.

What's entropy?\\n \\n \\n * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n \\n   A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\\n   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\\n   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\\n   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\\n   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\\n   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\\n   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\\n   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\\n   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\\n   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\\n \\n * What is an attack?\\n \\n   In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\\n   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\\n   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\\n   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\\n   mathematically what this means. Here we go.\\n \\n   Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\\n   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\\n \\n   An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\\n   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\\n   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\\n   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\\n   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\\n \\n   The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\\n   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\\n   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\\n   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\\n   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\\n   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\\n \\n   An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\\n   n = 2, and so on.\\n \\n * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n \\n   In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\\n   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\\n   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\\n   is strong!''\\n \\n   In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\\n   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\\n   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\\n   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\\n   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\\n   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\\n   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\\n   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\\n   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\\n \\n   Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\\n   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\\n   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\\n   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\\n   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\\n \\n   The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\\n   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\\n   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\\n   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\\n   \\n * Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n \\n   By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\\n   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\\n   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\\n   or) of K and P.\\n \\n   It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\\n   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\\n   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\\n   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\\n   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\\n   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\\n   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\\n   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\\n   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\\n   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\\n   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\\n   a fortiori A is trivial.)\\n \\n   On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\\n   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\\n   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\\n   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\\n   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\\n \\n * What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n \\n   In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\\n   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\\n   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\\n   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\\n   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\\n   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\\n \\n   For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\\n   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\\n   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\\n   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\\n   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\\n   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\\n   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\\n   a nontrivial attack.\\n \\n * What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n \\n   The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\\n   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\\n   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\\n   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\\n   other decryption P_2.\\n \\n   Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\\n   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\\n   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\\n   decrypt further messages.\\n \\n * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n \\n   A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\\n   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\\n   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\\n   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\\n   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\\n   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\\n   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\\n   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\\n \\n   A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\\n   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\\n   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\\n \\n   There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\\n   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\\n   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\\n   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\\n   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\\n \\n * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n \\n   Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\\n   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\\n   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\\n   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\\n \\n   If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\\n   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\\n   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\\n   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\\n   possible keys.\\n \\n * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n \\n   Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\\n   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\\n   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\\n   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\\n   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\\n   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\\n \\n   We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its\\n   entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''\\n   of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within\\n   2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is\\n   the probability of key K.\\n\",\n",

Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\\n   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\\n   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \\n   If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\\n   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\\n   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\\n   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\\n   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\\n \\n   2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\\n   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\\n   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\\n   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\\n   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\\n   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\\n \\n   If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\\n   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\\n   texts show how to break those. It\\'s possible with those methods, in\\n   the hands of an expert, if there\\'s only ten times as much text as key.\\n   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\\n \\n * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\\n \\n   Here\\'s one popular method, using the des command:\\n \\n     cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\\n \\n   Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\\n   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\\n   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\\n   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\\n   writing.\\n \\n   There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\\n   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\\n   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\\n   as well.\\n \\n   PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\\n   without a license and RSA\\'s patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\\n   in the USA.\\n \\n   RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\\n   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\\n   the USA.\\n \\n   Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\\n   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\\n   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\\n   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other\\'s formats and\\n   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\\n   we know).\\n \\n * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\\n \\n   No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\\n   breaker\\'s workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\\n   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\\n \\n * How do I use compression with encryption?\\n \\n   A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\\n   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\\n \\n   Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\\n   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it\\'s\\n   impossible to describe ``the typical English text\\'\\' beyond coarse\\n   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\\n   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\\n   has a slightly more accurate model, he\\'ll be able to find some\\n   redundancy in your compressed output.\\n \\n   Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\\n   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\\n   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\\n   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number\\'\\'\\n   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\\n   \\n   This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\\n   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\\n   removes the need for strong encryption.\\n \\n   Compression after encryption is silly.\\n \\n * Is there an unbreakable cipher?\\n \\n   Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\\n   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\\n   plaintext.\\n \\n   Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\\n   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\\n   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\\n   expected to remain valid.\\n \\n * What does ``random\\'\\' mean in cryptography?\\n \\n   Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\\n   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\\n   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\\n   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\\n   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\\n   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\\n \\n   A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\\n   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\\n   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\\n   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\\n   generated by a hardware random number source).\\n \\n   Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\\n   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\\n   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\\n \\n \\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\\n \\n   gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\\n   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\\n   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\\n   string.\\n \\n   When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\\n   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\\n   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\\n   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\\n   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\\n   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\\n \\n * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\\n \\n   See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\\n   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\\n   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\\n   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\\n   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\\n   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \\n   Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\\n   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\\n   from the opponent\\'s difficulty choosing the correct one.\\n \\n   Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\\n   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\\n   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\\n   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\\n   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\\n   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don\\'t normally\\n   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\\n   the likelihood of events of interest.\\n \\n   Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\\n   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\\n   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\\n   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\\n   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\\n   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\\n   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\\n   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\\n   intercepted.\\n \\n   In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\\n   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\\n   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\\n   it\\'s too small, but doesn\\'t guarantee security if it\\'s high.) Few\\n   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\\n   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges\\'\\' to crack\\n   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\\n   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\\n   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\\n   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\\n   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\\n   promising directions.\\n \\n   Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\\n   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\\n   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\\n   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\\n \\n * What is key management and why is it important?\\n \\n   One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\\n   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\\n   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\\n   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\\n   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\\n   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\\n   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\\n   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\\n   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\\n   also enough key material to cover the traffic.\\n \\n   Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\\n   handling of keys.\\n \\n   A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\\n   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\\n   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys\\'\\' and a central Key\\n   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\\n   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\\n   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\\n   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\\n   reporting of lost CIKs.\\n \\n   This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\\n   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\\n   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?\\'\\'\\n \\n * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\\n \\n   Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\\n   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\\n   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\\n   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\\n   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\\n   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\\n   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\\n   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\\n   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\\n   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\\n   structure at all.\\n \\n   See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\\n \\n * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\\n \\n   There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\\n   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\\n   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\\n   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly\\'\\' computed,\\n   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\\n \\n   The second answer is that the question doesn\\'t make sense. What do\\n   you mean by ``English letters\\'\\'? The ``English language\\'\\' is not a\\n   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\\n   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\\n   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\\n   the language as a whole.\\n \\n   The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\\n   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\\n   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won\\'t matter.\\n   In fact there\\'s an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics\\'\\' (other\\n   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods\\'\\' and ``maximum likelihood\\n   estimation\\'\\') which studies questions like ``What\\'s the chance that a\\n   text with these letter frequencies is in English?\\'\\' and comes up with\\n   reasonably robust answers.\\n \\n   So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\\n   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\\n \\n * What is the Enigma?\\n \\n   ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\\n   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\\n   the British during WWII.\\'\\'\\n \\n   See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\\n \\n * How do I shuffle cards?\\n \\n   Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\\n   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\\n   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\\n   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\\n   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\\n   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\\n   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\\n   addresses given)\\n \\n   for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\\n \\n   modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\\n   ranno()\\'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\\n   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()\\'s\\n   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\\n   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\\n \\n \\n * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\\n \\n   Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\\n   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\\n   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\\n   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\\n \\n   As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\\n   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\\n   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\\n   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\\n   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\\n   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\\n \\n   If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\\n   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\\n   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM\\'s data.\\n   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\\n   illegal copy.\\n \\n \\n * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\\n \\n   schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,\\n   Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\\n   popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number\\n   is (801) 224-6970\\n \\n   No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the\\n   subject....\\n \\n   Peleg, S. and Rosenfeld, A.  \"Breaking Substitution Ciphers Using a\\n   Relaxation Algorithm\" Comm.

Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n \\n   The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n \\n   A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n   cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n \\n   The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n   ciphertext into plaintext.\\n \\n   A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n \\n   The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n   eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n \\n * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n \\n   For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n   to the mid-60's.\\n \\n   Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n \\n   The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n \\n   The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n   networks.\\n \\n   The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n \\n * How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n \\n   Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n   classified.\\n \\n   Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n \\n * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n \\n   In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n \\n   Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n   brute-force search is impractical.\\n     \\n   Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n \\n   One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n \\n * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n \\n   The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n \\n   A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n   probably strong.\\n \\n   A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n     \\n   A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n \\n   If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n \\n * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n \\n   Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n   doesn't have a chance.\\n \\n   Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n   [KAH67].\\n   \\n * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n   relatively easy to break?\\n \\n   Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design\\n   secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst\\n   could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody\\n   to invest the work needed to crack a system.\\n\",\n",

Why am I here?\\n \\n   Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\\n   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\\n   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\\n   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\\n   readers want to see.\\n \\n * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\\n \\n   No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\\n   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\\n   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\\n   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\\n   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\\n   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\\n   postings in the right group.\\n \\n   Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\\n   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\\n \\n * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\\n \\n   ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\\n   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\\n   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\\n \\n   If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\\n   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\\n   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\\n   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\\n   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\\n   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\\n   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\\n   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\\n   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\\n \\n   So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\\n   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\\n   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\\n   introductory textbooks.\\n \\n   When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\\n   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\\n   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\\n   answered on your own.\\n \\n   If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\\n   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\\n   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\\n   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\\n   in some areas.)\\n \\n   If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\\n   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\\n   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\\n   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\\n   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\\n   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\\n   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\\n   layer of complication and come back for another round.\\n \\n   A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\\n   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\\n   of this FAQ.\\n \\n   Among professionals, a common rule of thumb is that if you want to\\n   design a cryptosystem, you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst.\\n\",\n",

(A ``block\\n   cipher\\'\\' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\\n   say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\\n   product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\\n   product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\\n   [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\\n   [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\\n   ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\\n   and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\\n   DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\\n \\n   The following table compares the main parameters of several product \\n   ciphers:\\n \\n   cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\\n   LUCIFER          128               128                16\\n   DES               64                56                16\\n   LOKI              64                64                16\\n   FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\\n   PES               64               128                 8\\n \\n * What makes a product cipher secure?\\n \\n   Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\\n   completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\\n   cipher ``looks highly random\\'\\'. For example, the cipher must be\\n   nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\\n   on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\\n   that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\\n   dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing\\'\\'\\n   function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\\n   complex nonlinear fashion.\\n \\n   The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\\n   referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\\n   has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\\n   careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\\n   for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\\n   found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\\n \\n * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\\n \\n   Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\\n   Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\\n   the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\\n   blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\\n   permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\\n   The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\\n   possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\\n   plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\\n   a large subset of S_{2^N}.\\n \\n   Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\\n   product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\\n   sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\\n   symmetric group: it consists of all ``even\\'\\' permutations, i.e., all\\n   permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\\n   Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\\n   that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\\n   of rounds.\\n \\n   The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\\n   group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\\n   extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\\n   not exist a third key K3 such that\\n \\n   E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\\n \\n   which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\\n   K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\\n   for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\\n   we say that E is a group.\\n \\n   This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\\n   extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\\n   paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\\n   group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\\n \\n * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\\n \\n   Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\\n   some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\\n   appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\\n   Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\\n   and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\\n   order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\\n   time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\\n   determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\\n   decision is no better than simply guessing.\\n \\n   Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\\n   are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\\n   random boolean functions.\\n \\n * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\\n \\n   There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\\n   ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\\n   Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\\n   published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\\n \\n   Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\\n   operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\\n \\n * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\\n \\n   One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\\n   that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \\n   whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\\n   cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \\n   thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\\n   that were authenticated using that key.\\n   \\n   See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\\n   authentication using DES.\\n \\n * What exactly is DES?\\n \\n   DES is the U.S. Government\\'s Data Encryption Standard - a product \\n   cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \\n \\n   It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\\n   FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\\n   DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\\n   defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \\n \\n * What is triple DES?\\n \\n   Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \\n   data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\\n   cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\\n   The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\\n \\n   Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\\n \\n   This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\\n   \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\\n   encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\\n   formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\\n   Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\\n \\n   That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\\n   DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\\n   security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\\n   security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\\n   single key.\"\\n \\n   Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\\n   E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\\n \\n   One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\\n   E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\\n   has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\\n   sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\\n   from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\\n   its own part.)\\n \\n * What is differential cryptanalysis?\\n \\n   Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\\n   applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\\n   a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\\n   Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\\n   S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\\n   This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\\n   notably FEAL [BI91a].\\n \\n   Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\\n   ciphertexts Y, Y\\' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X\\' satisfy a\\n   known difference D = X+X\\', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\\n   basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\\n   to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\\n   if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\\n   can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\\n   For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\\n   known plaintexts.\\n \\n   The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\\n   observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\\n   schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\\n   the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\\n   independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\\n   Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\\n   changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\\n   improvement in the differential attack.\\n \\n   Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\\n   that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\\n   of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.\\'\\'\\n \\n * How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\\n \\n   According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\\n   developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\\n   algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\\n   dictate a single wire!\\'\\' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\\n   DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\\n   Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\\n   basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\\n   and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\\n   containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\\n   `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\\n   secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,\\' explains Tuchman.\\'\\'\\n   \\n   On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\\n   the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\\n   Select Committee on Intelligence\\'\\', printed in the IEEE\\n   Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\\n   of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\\n   indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\\n   certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\\n   knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.\\'\\'\\n \\n   Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\\n   The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\\n   algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\\n   resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\\n   presented above.\\n \\n * Is DES available in software?\\n \\n   Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\\n   pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\\n   Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\\n   A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\\n \\n   FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\\n   implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\\n   Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\\n   compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\\n   implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\\n \\n * Is DES available in hardware?\\n \\n   The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\\n   We don\\'t vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\\n \\n   Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES\\n   encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\\n   telecom data streams.

In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n   ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n   that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n   from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n   That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n   and Hellman in 1976.\\n \\n   In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n   send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n   them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n   and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n \\n   This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n   extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n   applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n   mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n \\n * What's RSA?\\n \\n   RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n   Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n   RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n \\n   Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n   (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n   and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n   define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n \\n   Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n   anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n   (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n   secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n \\n * Is RSA secure?\\n \\n   Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n   See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n   algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n   prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n   matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n   ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n   ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n   prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n   theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n   results.''\\n \\n * How fast can people factor numbers?\\n \\n   It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n   and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n   weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n   each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n   algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n   bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n   n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\\n   any case.\\n \\n   An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n   polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\\n   log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n   but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n   and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n \\n   Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n   years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n   developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n   factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n   field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n   sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n \\n * What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n \\n   We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\\n   But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\\n   are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\\n   difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\\n   to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the\\n   books and journal articles listed in part 10.\\n\",\n",

Given the hash it is computationally\\n   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\\n   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\\n   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\\n   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\\n   same hash.\\n \\n   A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\\n   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\\n   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\\n   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\\n   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\\n   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\\n   signature can do the same thing.\\n \\n   Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\\n \\n * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\\n \\n   There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\\n   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\\n   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\\n   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\\n   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\\n   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\\n   if and only if X = H(M).\\n \\n   A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\\n   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\\n   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\\n   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\\n   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\\n   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\\n \\n   Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\\n   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\\n   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\\n   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend\\n   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing\\n   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.\\n \\n * What are MD4 and MD5?\\n \\n   MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.\\n   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is\\n   available from [FTPMD].\\n \\n   Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft\\n   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some\\n   people refer to it as MD5.\\n \\n * What is Snefru?\\n \\n   Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph\\n   Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.\\n   Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from\\n   [FTPSF].\\n\",\n",

It\\n   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40\\'s, and\\n   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\\n   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\\n   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\\n   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\\n   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\\n   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\\n   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\\n \\n   Bamford\\'s book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\\n   difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n \\n   ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\\n   years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n   between these two research communities. Open research is common\\n   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\\n   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n   undermine the effectiveness of his own government\\'s code-breakers?\\n   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n   force all governments to behave like Stimson\\'s `gentlemen\\', but one\\n   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.\\'\\'\\n \\n * What are the US export regulations?\\n \\n   In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\\n   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\\n   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\\n   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\\n   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\\n   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\\n \\n   The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\\n   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n   least heard of the ITAR.\\n \\n * What is TEMPEST?\\n \\n   TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\\n   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n   quite a distance and with little effort.\\n \\n   Needless to say, encryption doesn\\'t do much good if the cleartext\\n   is available this way.\\n \\n * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n \\n   (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\\n   corrections.)\\n \\n   The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\\n   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\\n   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\\n   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\\n \\n   Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\\n   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n \\n   The Beale Cypher Association\\n   P.O. Box 975\\n   Beaver Falls, PA 15010\\n \\n   You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\\n   line:\\n \\n   send index\\n \\n   in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\\n   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\\n   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n \\n   Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\\n   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\\n   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\\n   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\\n   string couldn\\'t appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n   string.\\n \\n * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n \\n   The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram\\'\\' includes\\n   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\\n   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n \\n   Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\\n   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\\n   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\\n \\n * Is RSA patented?\\n \\n   Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\\n   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\\n   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\\n   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\\n   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\\n   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\\n   ``should RSA be patented?\\'\\', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\\n   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\\n \\n * What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n \\n   nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\\n   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\\n   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\\n \\n   the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\\n \\n   There\\'s all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\\n   course.

The system for the\\n    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\\n    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\\n But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\\n so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\\n *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\\n need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\\n for the other 40-bit key.\\n \\n Similarly, it didn\\'t say \"We\\'re making encryption is commercially available.\"\\n because encryption *is* already commercially available, including\\n forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\\n And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\\n convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\\n \\n The next thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re making encryption legal\",\\n because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\\n President can\\'t change the First Amendment merely by decree.\\n What it *did* say was:\\n \\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\\n \\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\\n \\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\\n \\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\\n which clearly means \"We\\'re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\\n Soon.

The one most obviously\\n applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\\n specify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\\n \\n For example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\\n Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\\n in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\\n en entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\\n brute-force search for it?\\n \\n You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\\n one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \\n \\n agrep -3 \"qimwe7l\" bigwordandphraselist\\n \\n finds that the pattern \"qimwe7l\" is too close to the\\n pattern \"imsel\" (part of \"himself\" and a host of others),\\n to be of any cryptographic value as a key.\\n \\n An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\\n letters like \"teh\" for \"the\".  A minimally acceptable password\\n would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\\n ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\\n (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\\n *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\\n \\n \\n And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o\\'\\n typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\\n say I want to find out what people think about Gibson\\'s\\n SF book \"Neuromancer\" in the huge SF-Lover\\'s archives.\\n Even with an error distance specification as small as\\n of \"1\" I will find all those people who think the title\\n was \"Necromancer\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\\n \\n Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\\n at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\\n to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\\n religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\\n \\n You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\\n random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\\n don\\'t score the X chi-square \\'birthday\\' hits on message size Y.\\n \\n You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\\n the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\\n NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\\n National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\\n \\n You can also specify \"fixed\" areas: looking for license\\n plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\\n you might say:\\n \\n agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\\n \\n will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\\n (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\\n also \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\\n or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\\n for a particular protein combination, you might know that\\n some kinds of damage cause the \"A\" nucelotide to drop out more\\n than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\\n -Dc where you set the \"deletion cost\" to count as \"c\" errors.\\n \\n A steganographic use (I even used \"agrep -2 \"<steg>eograp\" E\"\\n just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\\n introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\\n and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\\n possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\\n \\n Also with agrep\\'s powerful extraction options it makes it easy\\n to abstract the \"hits\" into a useful form.

For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\n the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n \\n I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\n followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\n feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\n acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\n repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\n would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\n in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\n A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\n and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\n neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\n to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\n the subkeys even more.\\n \\n Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\n the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\n their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\n public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\n keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\n to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\n would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\n make sure they stop''.\\n \\n We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\n door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\n of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\n the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\n the warrant.\\n \\n I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\n public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\n more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\n used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\n the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\n long.\\n \\n I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\n the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\n back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\n about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\n scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\n rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\n DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\n was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\n the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\n without the back door.\\n \\n The cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.

The cost simply outweighs\\n any possible benefits, IMO.\\n \\n BTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been\\n promoting, in an even more disturbing form.\\n \\n That said, with no further comment, the article follows:\\n \\n ------------ Begin included article ---------\\n \\n Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\\n transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\\n via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\\n      ---------------------------------------------------\\n \\n                          THE WHITE HOUSE\\n \\n                   Office of the Press Secretary\\n \\n _________________________________________________________________\\n \\n For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\\n \\n \\n                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\\n \\n \\n The President today announced a new initiative that will bring\\n the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\\n program to improve the security and privacy of telephone\\n communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\\n enforcement.\\n \\n The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\n accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\n telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n \\n For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\n private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\n tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\n protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n \\n Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n \\n A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n commercial use today.\\n \\n This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n \\n A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n \\n \\n                                 2\\n \\n \\n \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n wiretap.\\n \\n The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n new authorities to access the content of the private\\n conversations of Americans.\\n \\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n their findings.\\n \\n The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n \\n      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n \\n      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n           calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n \\n      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n           technology to build the National Information\\n           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n           the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n           marketplace; and \\n \\n      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n           high technology products.\\n \\n The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n \\n \\n \\n                                 3\\n \\n The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n system transmits voice.\\n \\n Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n them from those who break the law.\\n \\n Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n encryption technology are also available.  \\n \\n For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n \\n ---------------------------------\\n \\n \\n QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n \\n A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n      no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n      conversations of Americans.\\n \\n Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n      decipher the message?\\n \\n A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n      escrow system.\\n \\n Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n \\n A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n \\n Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n      how strong the security is?  \\n \\n A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n      potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n      vulnerabilities.\\n \\n Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n \\n A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n      officials.\\n \\n Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n \\n A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n      decisions related to this initiative.\\n \\n Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n \\n A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n      manufacturer that produces them.\\n \\n Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n \\n A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n      to other vendors in the future.\\n \\n Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n \\n A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n      \\n Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n      powerful encryption devices?\\n \\n A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n      developing.\\n \\n      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n \\n Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n \\n A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n      and terrorism.\\n \\n Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n      the government hardware?\\n \\n A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n      of these products.\\n \\n ----------- End included article ----------- \\n \\n -- \\n pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA\\n          If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat\\n WISDOM: \"Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,\\n          and I am not sure about the former.\"              - Albert Einstien\\n',\n",

I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\\n establish alternatives to the government\\'s Clinton Clipper. As Brad\\n Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\\n enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\\n standard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\\n a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\\n mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\\n \\n (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\\n be to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\\n phony or untappable keys...I\\'m sure the next several weeks will see\\n these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\\n \\n Meanwhile, I\\'d be interested to hear RSA Data Security\\'s reaction.\\n Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\\n complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\\n general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\\n ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What\\'s a mere\\n licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\\n wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\\n RSA\\'s patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\\n would make tons of money and be happy, I\\'m sure. A small price to pay.\\n For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I\\'m sure the actual terms\\n could be different, spread out over several years, whatever.

Escrowing keys, sending copies of\\n keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\\n all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\\n *NOT* strong crypto!\\n \\n Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\\n patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\\n comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\\n that I said \"potential\"...we\\'ll presumably learn more in the coming\\n months).\\n \\n The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\\n attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\\n deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\\n \\n I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\\n using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\\n CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\\n Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\\n with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\\n to the Clipper system.\\n \\n Of course, we don\\'t really know if the Administration proposes to\\n outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\\n terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\\n if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\\n pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\\n few criminals is not the American way of doing things.

(Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any\\n private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly\\n evaluated?

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n  \\n It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n  \\n In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.

In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\n usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.

If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\n material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\n periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\n system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\n protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\n result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\n on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\n does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\n fishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\n right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\n and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\n figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\n those consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\n quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\n exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\n Don\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\n past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\n and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\n or \\'difficult\\'.\\n \\n >But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\\n >judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\\n >without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can\\'t record today\\'s plain\\n >cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\\n >listen to those tapes?\" can they?\\n \\n So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\n after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\n easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\n would authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\n has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\n local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\n have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\n for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\n in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\n via a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n \\n This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\n old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\n was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\n Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\n that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\n just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\n about civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\n is \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n \\n With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\n exist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\n scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\n court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\n Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\n they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\n keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\n awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\n they deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\n reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\n Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n \\n And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\n I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\n a competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\n to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\n one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\n concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n \\n >>worse, of course, if the government then uses this \"Clinton Clipper\"\\n >>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main\\n >>concern of most of us, I think.

That\\'s why he\\'s in jail now.\\n >Hard to believe, but true.\\n \\n What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\n can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\n It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\n argumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\n argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\n every room of one\\'s home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\n the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\n govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\n to \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\n pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n \\n Don\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\n bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n \\n >This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would\\n >fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so\\n >called \"Digital Telephony\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the\\n >meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\\n >on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\\n \\n People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\n because we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n \\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\n those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n \\n If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\n so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\n isolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\n certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\n experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\n advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\n experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\n Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\n version (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\n version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\n chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n :-)\\n \\n And isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\n have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\n I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\n you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\n group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n \\n Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\n be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\n but \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\n description (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\n I think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\n very\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\n acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\n Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\n countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\n revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\n protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\n have this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\n Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\n for yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\n the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\n many rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\n system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n \"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\n etc).\\n \\n BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\n this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\n this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\n under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\n have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\n Constitution.  It has to stop.

       " '\\n I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\\n on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\\n implications of some details are fascinating.\\n \\n -------\\n Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\\n From: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\n To: (a long list of recipients)\\n Subject: Clipper Chip\\n \\n \\n Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday\\'s NY Times,\\n etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\\n announcing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\\n on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\\n been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\\n the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\\n is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\\n to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\\n details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\\n to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\\n facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\\n if I have anything wrong):\\n \\n The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \\n Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \\n same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \\n specific. I don\\'t know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \\n call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \\n The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \\n that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \\n they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \\n it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \\n will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\n and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\n authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \\n decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \\n they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \\n must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \\n When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \\n present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \\n K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\\n \\n In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \\n or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \\n plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \\n encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \\n and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \\n message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \\n producing\\n \\n      E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n \\n When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \\n enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \\n flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \\n they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \\n court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \\n over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \\n \\n      E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\\n \\n in the above message. They then check the serial number \\n of the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \\n have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \\n and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\\n \\n I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \\n not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \\n scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \\n more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \\n order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \\n necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \\n needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\\n needed, the following story adds some color: In researching\\n some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\\n I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\\n here at Stanford and he related the following story: When\\n Edward Levi became Pres. Ford\\'s attorney general (right\\n after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\\n for \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\\n the details so he could review the cases as required by\\n law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\\n over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\\n comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \\n No single person or authority should have the power to\\n authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\\n keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\\n and sometimes a John Mitchell.\\n \\n Martin Hellman\\n \\n ----\\n \\n Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\\n From: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\n To: smb@research.att.com\\n Subject: Re: Clipper Chip\\n \\n It is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \\n if you also post this message with it in which:\\n \\n 1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info \\n from me or asking for comments on specific questions. By\\n this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to\\n respond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much\\n e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other\\n responsibilities.) \\n \\n 2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning.\\n She met with the person from NSA that\\n I talked with by phone, so her understanding is likely to\\n better than mine on this point: Where I said the transmitted\\n info is  E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n she says the message is not double encrypted. The system\\n key (or family key as she was told it is called) only encrypts\\n the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted\\n unit key. This is not a major difference, but I thought it\\n should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to\\n my attention. It makes more sense since it cuts down\\n on encryption computation overhead.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n \\n      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers\\n the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother\\n (Clipper) chip.\\n      The drug dealers and terrorists aren\\'t going to let\\n themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985\\n the New York Times reported that government investigators broke\\n up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\\n equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\\n eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\\n them.\\n      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\\n medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\\n signals intelligence operation of this group.\"\\n      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\\n have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\\n communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\\n only increase their numbers.\\n      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\\n use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\\n and civil liberties questions involved.\\n      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\\n an investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\\n suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\\n shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\\n conviction rate high.\\n      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\\n (even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\\n because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\\n what is ethically and morally right.\\n      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\\n should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.

It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\\n Bill 266 in 1991.\\n \\n Possible actions to take in response:\\n \\n 1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\\n more.\\n \\n 2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\\n technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\\n write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\\n newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \\n Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\\n slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\\n arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\\n libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \\n \\n 3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\\n Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\\n Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\\n technology issues.  Talk to those aides.\\n \\n 4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\\n would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\\n the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\\n surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\\n spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\\n activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\\n that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\\n themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\\n want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\\n \\n 4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\\n Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\\n these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\\n expenses and lobbying.\\n \\n 5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\\n develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\\n lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\\n telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\\n coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\\n present your company's management with a united front of engineering\\n talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\\n management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.

Being a PhD-student at David\\n Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\n in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n \\n The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\n retrieved from\\n \\n ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n \\n from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\n The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n \\n ====================================================================\\n ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\n system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\n little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\n first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\n representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\n introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\n payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\n systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\n both computation and communication complexity than any such system\\n proposed previously.\\n   \\n Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\n Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\n mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\n make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\n ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\n Diffie-Hellman problem. \\n   \\n Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\n previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\n is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\n incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\n the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\n first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\n after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\n most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\n which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\n Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\n negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\n a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\n previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\n can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\n retaining its computational efficiency.\\n ====================================================================\\n \\n Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n \\n I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\n possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\\n me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\\n on Clipper.\\n \\n The name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\\n \\n Martin Hellman had written\\n \\n                 and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\\n                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\\n                 producing\\n \\n                      E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n \\n To which I responded:\\n \\n         My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\\n         \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\\n         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\\n \\n I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\\n being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\\n for the family key SK.\\n \\n         The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\n         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\\n         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\\n         Compute the 64-bit block\\n \\n                 R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\\n \\n         (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\\n         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\\n         (I\\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\\n         they\\'re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\\n         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\\n         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\\n \\n The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\\n a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\\n so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\\n an entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\\n numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\\n thrown out if desired).\\n \\n The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\\n by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\\n for each value).\\n \\n The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\\n up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\\n floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\\n escrow agencies.\\n \\n Dorothy Denning\\n denning@cs.georgetown.edu\\n \\n --------------------------------------------------------\\n I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\\n Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\\n with it\\'s contents and implications.

       " \"\\n Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.\\n \\n First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\\n Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\\n \\n The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\\n general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\\n ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\\n consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\\n seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\\n So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \\n Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \\n (Or is it one key per direction ?)\\n They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\\n Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\\n which is now ready to work.\\n The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\\n These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\\n with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\\n At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\\n before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\\n chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\\n and the session key. This might look like\\n X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\\n where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\\n This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\\n After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\\n being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\\n \\n Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\\n Bit's.\\n \\n Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\\n being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\\n scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\\n \\n As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \\n obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\\n the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\\n imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\\n for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\\n \\n Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\\n could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\\n each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\\n assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\\n law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\\n and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\\n and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\\n chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\\n How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\\n the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\\n this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\\n after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\\n but I guess politics will not work that way.\\n \\n Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\\n of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\\n cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\\n the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\\n is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\\n cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\\n to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\\n as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\\n company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\\n will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\\n by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\\n \\n What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\\n first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\\n key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\\n difficult to do *that* :^)\\n \\n And now a last point, for the other side.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies\\n seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that\\n we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have\\n to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws\\n and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed\\n them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has\\n to be changed.\\n \\n Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug\\n informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact\\n with the Devil himself.  It\\'s a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are\\n motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy\\n way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more\\n incentive for the agencies to take property.\\n \\n It\\'s also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that\\n Clinton would have the \"plumbers\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his\\n henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a\\n leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that\\n control and take more.\\n \\n WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the\\n equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take\\n responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.\\n \\n        __  Paul J.

       " '\\n The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,\\n how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the\\n escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.\\n Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my\\n own involvement in this project, I\\'d like to add that I was not in\\n any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\\n Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\\n time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\\n attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \\n The document below is the result of that effort. \\n \\n Dorothy Denning\\n ---------------\\n \\n                      THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\\n \\n                                Dorothy Denning\\n \\n                                 April 19, 1993\\n \\n \\n INTRODUCTION\\n \\n On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\\n together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\\n to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\\n law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\n chip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\n escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\n both are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n \\n \\n CHIP STRUCTURE\\n \\n The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\\n algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\\n with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\\n for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\\n 16 Mbits a second.\\n \\n Each chip includes the following components:\\n \\n    the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n    N, a 30-bit serial number\\n    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n \\n \\n ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n \\n To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\n telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\n we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\n conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\\n the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\\n be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\\n fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\\n \\n    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \\n \\n The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\\n under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\\n encrypted under the family key F.\\n \\n \\n CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n \\n All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\\n information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\n a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\n are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\n Mikotronx.\\n \\n At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\n escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\\n into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\\n serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\\n \\n To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n 64-bit block R1:\\n \\n         R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n \\n         R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n         R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n agencies.\\n \\n As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n assurance that no information is left behind.\\n  \\n The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n the escrow agencies.\\n \\n The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\n be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\n both may be independent from the government.\\n \\n \\n LAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n \\n When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\n will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\n access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\n place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\\n Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\\n family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\\n warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\\n agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\\n the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\\n Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\\n through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\\n \\n \\n ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on\\n information provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to\\n distribute this document is granted.\\n \\n \\n     \\n',\n",

       " '\\n Here is a disturbing thought.\\n \\n Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\\n the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\\n get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\n I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\n houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n \\n Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\n serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\n this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\n population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\n each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\n valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\n cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\n pocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n \\n Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\n database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\n in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\n by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\n will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\n some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\n tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\n doubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\n prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n \\n With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\n every person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\n need the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\n that have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n \\n Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\n isn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\n political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\n ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\n evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\n a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\n secrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\n our companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\n unexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n \\n Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\n and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\n many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\n fraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n \\n Don\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\n the escrow databases.\\n \\n We crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\n beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\n easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\n secret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\n teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\n would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\\n Clipper chips.\\n \\n I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\\n doesn\\'t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\\n many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\\n that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\\n doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\\n to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\\n that they realize that they can\\'t put things off forever, but they can\\n try to delay things as long as possible.\\n \\n Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\\n bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\\n that this scheme might give people some security, even as their\\n subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\\n it all.\\n \\n --\\n Perry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n --\\n Laissez faire, laissez passer.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\\n derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\\n there are only one billion possible unit keys.\\n \\n    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n    64-bit block R1:\\n \\n \\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n    Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n \\n \\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n \\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n    R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n    agencies.\\n \\n Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\\n number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\\n is an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\\n U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\\n change they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\\n theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\\n completely obviates the security of the system. However, more\\n interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\\n matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\\n and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\\n if it NOT to provide an additional back door?\\n \\n I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\\n approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\\n the back of a napkin.\\n \\n Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\\n restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\\n assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\\n goal is an illusion of security.\\n \\n If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\\n they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\\n pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\\n understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\\n soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\\n espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\\n -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\\n by the time we know it may be too late.\\n \\n    As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n    assurance that no information is left behind.\\n \\n None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\\n \"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\\n We all know that you can\\'t read data from DRAM that has been turned\\n off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don\\'t know\\n is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\\n first place other than to weaken the system. We don\\'t know if the\\n agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\\n information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\\n the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\\n this in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\\n with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\\n high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\\n for most of the rest of us.\\n \\n    The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n    the escrow agencies.\\n \\n What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\\n the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\\n honest. Who cares?

The new cryptography scheme was\\n announced today by the White House and the National Institute\\n for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\\n technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\\n acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\\n secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\\n encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\\n \\n         According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\\n Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\\n open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\\n filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\\n with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\\n Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\\n plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\\n Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\\n open the development of non-military computer security standards\\n to public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of\\n such standards.\\n \\n         CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\\n developing the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\\n communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\\n government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\\n lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\\n time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\\n NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\\n the classification of records concerning its creation of the\\n DSS.\\n \\n         David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\\n administration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of\\n electronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official\\n statement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\\n the propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent\\n secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\\n public scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\\n development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\\n that standards designed to protect personal privacy be\\n established openly and with full public participation.  It is\\n not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\\n secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\\n play a leading role in the development process.\"\\n \\n         CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\\n industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\\n technology on society.

The language sort of suggests this, but it\\'s hard to say.\\n \\n I\\'d lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect\\n to make it a phone you\\'d need a codec and speech compression.  There would\\n be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper\\n any of the suggestions I\\'ve seen here about putting a different encryption\\n front end on it.\\n \\n There\\'s no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I\\'m sure it\\'s purely\\n a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I\\'m *positive* it won\\'t\\n be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation\\n scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.\\n \\n The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.\\n (Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )\\n \\n G\\n',\n",

       " '\\n One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration\\n body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\\n essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people\\'s civil\\n liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\n involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\n reason.\\n \\n When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\n auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\n security point of view, but wouldn\\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always\\n figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\n the problem.\\n \\n Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\n Auditors don\\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\n bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\n auditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\\n compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\\'s\\n job.\\n \\n Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\n Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\\'s part, a key half gets\\n away that shouldn\\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\n liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\\n But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\\n and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\\n \\n There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\\n place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\\n automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\\n was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\\n was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\\n \\n I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\\n situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\\n checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\\n today, he better be able to produce yesterday\\'s checks so that they can\\n be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\\n legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\\n put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\\n conflict of interest.\\n \\n As always, my opinions are my own.\\n \\n Lynn Grant\\n Grant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL\\n',\n",

Macchiavelli, as translated by\\n Daniel Donno.]\\n \\n \\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\\n disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\\n cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\\n themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\\n initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\\n destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\\n judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\\n circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\\n nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\\n will allow.\\n \\n \\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\\n disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\\n proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\\n arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\\n while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\\n are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\\n nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\\n extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\\n the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\\n the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\\n and dangers should receive advantages.  \\n \\n \\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\\n showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\\n distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\\n Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\\n have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\\n discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\\n good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\\n subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\\n state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\\n full of examples proving that this is so.\\n \\n \\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\\n annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\\n the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\\n it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\\n soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\\n the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\\n his original domain.\\n \\n \\t...\\n \\n \\tAnd since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind\\n any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants\\n that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the\\n reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction\\n with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to\\n keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he\\n will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn\\n from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much\\n easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former\\n government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of\\n those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to\\n replace it.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\n would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\n if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\n of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n \\n That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\n Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\n Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\n foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\n Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\n journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n \\n A little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\n expertise.\\n \\n Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\n before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\n USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\n professional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\n magazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n \\n He\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\n Webster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\n fifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\n continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\n of the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n \\n That sounds like an expert to me.\\n \\n After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\n myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\n the following letter:\\n \\n \"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\n English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\n States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n \\n \"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\n necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\n and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n \\n \"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\n sentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\n free State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\n to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\n right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n \\n \"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\n consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\n entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\n since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\n regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\n analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\n stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\n oath to support, if necessary.\"\\n \\n My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\n then concluded:\\n \\n \"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\n with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\n vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\n While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\n its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n \\n After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\n his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\n opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\n subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\n inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\n security of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\n letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\n clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\n followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n \\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\n maintaining a militia.\\n \\n \"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\n and bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\n arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\n others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\n to a right of the people.\"\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\n by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\n preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\n that such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\n is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\n preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\n conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\n necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\n existing, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\n shall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\n keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\n of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\n right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\n militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\n and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\n to the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\n conditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\n right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\n previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\n militia.\"\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\n militia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n \\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\n authority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\n control over the military.\"\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\n changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\n years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\n intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\n meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\n amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\n well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\n right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n \\n [Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\n appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\n Amendment to the following sentence,\\n \\n \"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\n State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\n infringed.\\'\\n \\n \"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n \\n \"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\n the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\n and\\n \\n \"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\n to keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\n example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n \\n [Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\n amendment in grammatical structure.\\n \\n \"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\n possibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n \\n Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\n cover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\n efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\n any conclusion.\"\\n \\n So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\n many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\n protects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\n governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n \\n As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\n Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\n part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\n old guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n \\n And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\n officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\n ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\n American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\n arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\n regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\n abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\n guaranteed by the Constitution.\\n \\n And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\n rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n \\n it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\n preserve that right.  no one else will.

Isn\\'t\\n that nice?\\n \\n While the Feds can bust into one\\'s safe without the keys, the owner\\n knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your \\'secure\\'\\n phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)\\n you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has\\n gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they\\n can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to\\n a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:\\n Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys\\n obtained from the suspect.\\n \\n This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any\\n priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful\\n political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.\\n Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all\\n of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will\\n by into this monstrosity.

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\\n police agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\\n (but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said:\\n \\n    Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n         a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n         encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n         decipher the message?\\n \\n    A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^\\n         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n \\n The clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\\n than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \\n knows what\\'s in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\\n may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\\n keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\\n position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\\n already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\\n are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens\\' rights to access\\n police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\\n very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\\n evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\\n \\n Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\\n restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who\\'ve \"retired\" from intelligence\\n agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\\n \\n Don\\'t think it\\'ll happen?  \\n \\n Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\\n organization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \\n commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\\n of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\\n happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People\\'s Friendship\\n rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\\n plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \\n meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\\n (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\\n more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\\n as well.)\\n \\n Even with well-meaning cops (and I\\'m sure there are many), there will \\n be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don\\'t need\\n to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \\n of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \\n Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \\n will be a moral dilemma.\\n \\n Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

The program \\n for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of \\n the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees \\n at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.\\n \\n In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the \\n program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for \\n informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to \\n demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. \\n If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General \\n Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include \\n hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a \\n beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included \\n in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.\\n \\n ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of \\n the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent \\n to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are \\n available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference \\n participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the \\n dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate \\n arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is \\n enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. \\n However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire \\n a parking permit.\\n \\n TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the \\n Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including \\n American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service \\n will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday \\n and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented \\n in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the \\n north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles \\n north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.\\n \\n REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance \\n at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late \\n registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space \\n is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached \\n registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in \\n full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first \\n come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The \\n conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions, \\n as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of \\n Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals \\n >from dinner on Sunday to lunch on Thursday. Technical sessions will run \\n >from Monday morning to Thursday at noon. A very limited number of stipends \\n are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends \\n should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.\\n \\n ............................................................................\\n         CRYPTO '93  -  CRYPTO '93 Registration Form \\n ............................................................................\\n                        REGISTRATION DEADLINE: July 9, 1993\\n \\n Last Name:   _____________________________________________\\n \\n First Name:  _____________________________________________ Sex: (M)__  (F)__\\n \\n Affiliation: _______________________________________________________________ \\n \\n Mailing Address:  __________________________________________________________\\n \\n                   __________________________________________________________\\n \\n                   __________________________________________________________\\n \\n                   ___________________________________________________________\\n \\n Phone:  __________________________________ FAX:  ___________________________ \\n \\n Electronic Mail:  __________________________________________________________ \\n \\n Payment of the conference fee entitles you to membership in the International \\n Association for Cryptologic Research for one year at no extra charge, \\n including a subscription to the Journal of Cryptology, published by Springer-\\n Verlag, at no extra charge.

Those who choose to stay off campus are \\n responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are \\n advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta \\n is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be \\n required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject \\n to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels \\n directly. However, mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and \\n in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate \\n which can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to \\n block rooms in these hotels, so please make reservations as early as \\n possible. The quality of the hotels range from rather expensive beach-front \\n resorts to basic inexpensive accommodations.

And key size is one of the things that can be\\n verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\\n chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\n output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\n bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n \\n If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\n some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\n they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\n DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\n change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\\n NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\\n \\n Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\\n the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\\n subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\\n can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\\n later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\\n secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\\n it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\\n (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\\n members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\\n you have to XOR together to recover the program...\\n \\n Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.

       " '\\n    As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\\n Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\\n is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\\n of this message on how to contact them).\\n \\n    Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\\n we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\\n brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\\n \\n    His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\\n rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\\n \\n  - A company of AT&T\\'s size could never be able to make a decision to use\\n    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\\n \\n  - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T\\'s secure telephone\\n    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\\n    This stuck them as strange, until now...\\n \\n \\n    Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\\n concerns over the new Clipper Chip:\\n \\n   - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\\n \\n   - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\\n     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\\n     of the government.\\n \\n   - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\\n     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\\n \\n   - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\\n     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\\n     changing the keys themselves.\\n \\n   - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\\n     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\\n     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\\n     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\\n     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\\n     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\\n \\n Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn\\'t tell\\n me much about their new agorithm because it hasn\\'t been patented yet.\\n However he told me a little:\\n \\n  - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\\n    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\\n    secure.\\n \\n  - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\\n    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\\n    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\\n    the following:\\n \\n     - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\\n       Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\\n \\n     - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\\n \\n     - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\\n \\n     - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\\n       it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\\n \\n     - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\\n       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\\n       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\\n       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\\n \\n     - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\\n       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\\n       hardware chip.\\n \\n     - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\\n       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\\n       enough, which probably won\\'t happen]).\\n \\n     - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\\n       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\\n       data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\\n       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\\n       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\\n \\n     - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\\n \\n \\n \\n Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\\n of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\\n stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

Furthermore, its promotion as\\n providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far\\n as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal\\n of letting LE wiretap \"terrorists and drug dealers\" is to restrict\\n stronger techniques.  \\n \\n Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or\\n (the vast majority) no encryption.

At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\n chip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\n escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\n both are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n \\n \\n CHIP CONTENTS\\n \\n The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\\n encryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\\n (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\\n (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\\n operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\n Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n \\n Each chip includes the following components:\\n \\n    the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n \\n The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\\n \"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\\n implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\\n $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\\n technology is shrunk to .8 micron.\\n \\n \\n ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n \\n To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\n telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\n we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\n conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\n with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\n without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\n be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n \\n Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\n encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\n telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\n values:\\n \\n    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n \\n which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\n field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\n concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\n key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\n an authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n \\n The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver\\'s device using the\\n session key:\\n \\n    D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\\n \\n \\n CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n \\n All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\\n Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\n a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\n are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\n Mykotronx.\\n \\n At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\n escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\\n 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\\n 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\n keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\n function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n   \\n To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n 64-bit block R1:\\n \\n         R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n \\n         R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n         R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n \\n R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n agencies.\\n \\n As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\\n an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\\n know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\\n key parts.  \\n \\n The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\\n programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\\n leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\\n information is left behind.\\n  \\n The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n the escrow agencies. \\n \\n The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\n be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\n both may be independent from the government.\\n \\n \\n LAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n \\n When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\n will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\n access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\n place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\\n Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\\n family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\\n has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\\n then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\\n return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\\n together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\\n session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\\n be accomplished through a special black box decoder.\\n \\n \\n CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\\n \\n A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\\n and \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\\n the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\\n Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\\n exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\\n testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\\n delivery in June or July.\\n \\n \\n ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

       " \"\\n \\n \\n \\tAfter reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to\\n add.\\n \\n \\tFirst, most of the people I know who activly use encryption\\n privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,\\n and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they\\n care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\n after all IS the bottom line. \\n \\n \\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\n of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\n still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\n looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\n of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\n their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\n mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\n just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n \\n \\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\n familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\n stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\n someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\n That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\n not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n \\n \\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\n people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\n built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\n do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\n to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\n looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n \\n \\n \\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\n the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\n simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\n else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\n not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\n slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\n convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\n the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n \\n \\n \\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\n unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\n related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\n charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n \\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\n useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\n out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\n has been opened), and this is not going to change.

       " '\\n : From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff)\\n : Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu>\\n : It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\\n : would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\\n : probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.\\n \\n I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.\\n Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record\\n calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants\\n and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this\\n strategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\n in the near term.)\\n \\n In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\n inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\n interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\n that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\n but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n \\n Note that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\n feasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\n warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\n start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\n decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\n gets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n \\n While I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\n archiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\n collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\n slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\n stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\n get to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\n streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\n teller machines, don\\'t we?\\n \\n And then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\n places.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\n to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\n cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\n after.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\n curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\n be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\n VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n \\n And hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n \\n After all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n \\n Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\n pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\n crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\n of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\n execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\n competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \\n I can\\'t imagine why.\\n \\n --\\n Wayne Throop   throopw%sheol@concert.net\\n                throop%aurgate@concert.net\\n',\n",

It supports all 4 DES modes of\\n operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\n Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n \\n Each chip includes the following components:\\n \\n    the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n \\n .\\n .\\n .\\n \\n ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n \\n To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\n telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\n we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\n conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\n with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\n without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\n be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n \\n Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\n encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\n telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\n values:\\n \\n    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n \\n which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\n field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\n concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\n key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\n an authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n \\n ------------------\\n \\n suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but\\n did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from\\n if law enforcement field \\n    E[E[K; U] + N; F]\\n not knowing N would might make this much harder.\\n \\n Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),\\n If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U\\n for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the\\n other party.\\n \\n If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could\\n make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also\\n allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are\\n saying but I could know who you are saying it too.\\n \\n Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of\\n messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key\\n generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that\\n matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U\\'s will be\\n chosen from know weak keys for the system.\\n \\n Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement\\n for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that\\n it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of\\n people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \"panel of experts\" is\\n going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget\\n grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.\\n \\n So, am I wrong?

       " '\\n               WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?\\n \\n                         by Robin Hanson\\n                      Draft, April 21, 1993\\n \\n   SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,\\n   wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the\\n   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \\n   in three thousand to be cost-effective. \\n \\n BACKGROUND\\n \\n Until now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\\n detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\\n time, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\\n aid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\\n technologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\\n private communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\\n literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\\n microphones at either end.\\n \\n In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\\n phone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\\n that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\\n to be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\\n which have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\\n announced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\\n products\".\\n \\n Each chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\\n be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\\n each conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\\n info in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\\n with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\\n indentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\\n on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\\n \\n To date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\\n security.  The government won\\'t disclose the encryption algorithm, and\\n many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\\n has claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\\n inspire confidence on this point [1].\\n \\n However, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\\n whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\\n investigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\\n investigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\\n give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\\n Or to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\\n each wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\\n of forcing phones to support wiretaps?\\n \\n To start to answer this question, we might compare the current\\n benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\\n costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\\n benefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\\n \\n WIRETAP BENEFITS\\n \\n 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\\n [2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\\n requests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\\n with the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\\n resulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\\n wiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\\n 76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\\n regarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\\n authorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\\n calls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\\n average of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\\n reporting costs), mostly for labor.\\n \\n Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\\n about 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\\n least four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\\n gets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\\n total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\\n year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\\n expenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\\n lines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\\n phone line, or about two cents a month.\\n \\n In general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\\n of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\\n expected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\\n wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\\n the same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\\n wiretap a particular suspect\\'s phone, police might instead use hidden\\n microphones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\\n might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\\n we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\\n \\n If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\\n on average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\\n benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\\n of two cents a month per phone line.\\n \\n WIRETAP COSTS\\n \\n Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\\n encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\\n have offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\\n ears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\\n domestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\\n additional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\\n \\n Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\\n increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\\n be used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\\n these keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\\n The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\\n design is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\\n process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\\n (Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\\n lots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\\n wiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\\n \\n Perhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\\n replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\\n be represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\\n widely believed that governments are less efficient than private\\n enterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\\n perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\\n standards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\\n they pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \\n \\n Currently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\\n U.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\\n access line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\\n month, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\\n as much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\\n And this doesn\\'t even include extra costs phone owners pay because\\n their encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\\n wouldn\\'t have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\\n per phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\\n \\n CONCLUSION\\n \\n Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\\n phone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\\n slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\\n When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\\n attach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\\n But when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\\n clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\\n would really be less than the benefits.  \\n \\n If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\\n compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\\n rate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\\n nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\\n \\n [1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\\n \\n [2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\\n     Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\\n     Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\\n \\n [3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \\n \\n [4] Dorothy Denning, \"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\",\\n     distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993. \\n -- \\n Robin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov \\n 415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035\\n 510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921 \\n',\n",

Is the Clipper chip going to be exported?  If not, how will\\n people communicate with other countries?  Will they have to do\\n that in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques be\\n legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when\\n going overseas, but not within the states?\\n \\n 2.  I\\'ve read about authentication systems that use an electronic  \\n security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted\\n PIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithm\\n built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.\\n Is there some form of encryption technology that would create\\n keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The \\n systems would then allow a \"window\" of time around this instant\\n where the key would work.\\n I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information\\n needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather\\n than just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work.\\n Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that\\n are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week\\n (for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they would have\\n to go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This would\\n make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.\\n \\n I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need\\n to be able to decypher the message.

Some of the information in the posting requires some\\n clarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions\\n raised on sci.crypt.\\n      SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our\\n two main products at this time are a PC based secure\\n communications program called SECOM and a general purpose\\n encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.\\n      SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link\\n between two PC\\'s connected over dial up telephone lines.  It\\n supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard\\n to screen \"chat\".  It has its own proprietary communications\\n protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All\\n though it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be\\n continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.\\n      When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to\\n use DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export\\n approval for the product because it was perceived that the\\n overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing\\n opportunity.\\n      We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general\\n export approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason\\n for this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something\\n to do with secret government to government agreements which are\\n still in effect.\\n      In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and\\n different algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was\\n the reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.\\n      At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The\\n preliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to\\n make it public once the patent process is complete.  All though\\n one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing\\n secret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is\\n necessary to let people \"shoot at it\" over an extended period of\\n time to prove its worth.\\n      In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was\\n necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of\\n the program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a\\n finished product to submit.\\n      Let me state unequivocally that there is NO \"back door\" to\\n the program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications\\n Technologies is a closely held private company and\\n NSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way\\n whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.\\n      From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in\\n selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a\\n back door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our\\n credibility and our business.\\n      With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set\\n out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption\\n products and systems.  We were able to identify several common\\n threads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of\\n a chip with the encryption algorithm \"cast in silicon\" and\\n certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill\\n the broad range of requirements that we identified.\\n      We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a\\n press release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:\\n \\n           \"It seems as if the government has an unlimited source\\n      of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American\\n      Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security\\n      Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic\\n      spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip\\n      intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying\\n      activities.\"\\n \\n      If they had asked me to put a \"back door\" in NEA I would\\n have told them to g__ f____ed.\\n      Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,\\n RSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?  I don\\'t\\n know and probably never will.\\n',\n",

Emphasize that you are part of the group that will\\n \\t  be making/developing/using Clinton\\'s \\'data superhighway.\\'\\n \\n \\t- Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing\\n \\t  and data communications. (if this is the case; don\\'t call your-\\n \\t  self an \\'expert\\' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This\\n \\t  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  Don\\'t\\n \\t  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the\\n \\t  technical sides of the issue.\\n \\n \\t- Don\\'t overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember, your letter\\n \\t  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may\\n \\t  even be a college student; if they don\\'t understand it, your\\n \\t  views won\\'t even make the \\'running total\\' sheets.\\n \\n \\t- Be concise; don\\'t ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place.\\n \\t  Cite references, if necessary, but only use \"accepted\" references\\n \\t  like academic journals.  \"My neighbor Jim\" is *not* a real refer-\\n \\t  ence.  8)\\n \\n \\t- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand\\n \\t  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access\\n \\t  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer\\n \\t  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer\\n \\t  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your\\n \\t  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they\\'re in\\n \\t  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them\\n \\t  *will* give your opinions more credence.\\n \\n \\t- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail\\n \\t  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing\\n \\t  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn\\'t on the committee,\\n \\t  they can\\'t be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.\\n \\n --Wes\\n \\n ps> I\\'d suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the\\n     more traditional media, but Usenet doesn\\'t have a decent track record\\n     in the analogy department.  8)\\n \\n -- \\n Rachel Elizabeth Morgan  --  4/13/93, 7:00 am    | Oh yeah, I can be reached as\\n 9 pounds 4 ounces (despite coming 3 weeks early) |     morgan@engr.uky.edu\\n                                                  |-----------------------------\\n To netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything!\\n',\n",

       " '\\n \\n -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n \\n Gasp!\\n \\n I\\'ve just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader I\\n guess) and I really have to put out a few comments too.  First, let me\\n flame the famous Dave S. : He\\'s obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him\\n some slack. :^}\\n \\n The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job\\n guys!  I\\'ve been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years\\n now, Clinton\\'s actions so far have really helped.  But because of\\n government action taken against various other groups, I have developed\\n a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.\\n The S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57\\n based on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it\\n slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a\\n different set of s-boxes, I know it\\'s only a vector, but it sure makes\\n random search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had\\n their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug\\n use/sales.  It\\'s not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,\\n *but* you will be watched.\\n \\n It really is important to write a letter to every official you\\n personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by\\n the \"cripple chip\".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get\\n *enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and\\n the IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we\\n *are* seeing some changes.\\n \\n It\\'s pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the\\n implimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin\\n points out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\\n again depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\\n and \"law abiding\" citizens don\\'t, and criminals like me have marijuana\\n and \"law abiding\" subjects don\\'t, criminals like me will have secure\\n crypto while \"law abiding\" robots don\\'t.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\\n on we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\\n \\n Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He\\'s my favorite dude.\\n 500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\\n that to \"princes\" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\\n (I\\'ve got \"The Prince\" at home, so I\\'ll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\\n with conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\\n it.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\\n the people\\'s customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\\n will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\\n government.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\\n Thomas Jefferson.\\n \\n There were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\\n is watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\\n like marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\\n subversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\\n you know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it\\'s pretty easy\\n to go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\\n less you\\'re noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\\n which can diseminate truth to the masses.\\n \\n Which gets me to the thread about a \"public encrypted conference\".\\n That\\'s just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\\n infiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you\\'re doing.  It will be\\n fun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it\\'s\\n pretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\\n you get your marijuana.\\n \\n Guns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\\n government who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\\n alt.drugs \"Live free or don\\'t\".  Machiavelli pointed out that\\'s just\\n how most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\\n It\\'s true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\\n Intergraph\\'s!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\\n U.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\\n called bureaucrats and there\\'s less to worry about than one might\\n think.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\\n hurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\\n de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\\n majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\\n \\n And given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\\n National Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\\n \\n Patience, persistence, truth,\\t\\twork: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\\n Dr. mike\\t\\t\\t\\thome: mrosing@igc.org\\n \\n -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n Version: 2.2\\n \\n iQBVAgUBK9hETK3mm/E84rLHAQFV+gH9ExvzfXbNR4x0BTg2nQIxB5/ZMaxT289B\\n G4QjTsv8mszMrzU1DcJ8eLIQ37BwX53jATBH9U4B/biqmGKiPzHCmA==\\n =S3hf\\n -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n \\n',\n",

(email: fw@world.std.com)\\n My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\\n Oracle Corp.\\n \\n The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \\n features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\\n included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \\n use table views to refine the granularity of access control.\\n \\n One important security consideration in networked installations\\n is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\\n authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \\n _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \\n not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \\n of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \\n servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\\n option), while relying on host security for local processes. \\n \\n Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \\n audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\\n data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\\n risks from within the Oracle environment.\\n \\n Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\\n encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\\n to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \\n since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \\n choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \\n to your oracle database files through the host operating system, \\n s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \\n cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\\n \\n As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\\n Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\\n s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \\n the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\\n alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\\n which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\\n provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \\n guessable. \\n \\n As with all computer security, the most important defense is to \\n educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques\\n are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, \\n (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System \\n Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) \\n \\n \\n \\n Forrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com\\n Boston Scientific Corp.

Now, in the days when people had lived in\\n mud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood\\n technology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in\\n Ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until\\n this point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on\\n someone\\'s home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being\\n a civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars\\n and watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,\\n would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going\\n on. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but\\n everyone pretended that this didn\\'t happen.\\n \\n One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,\\n suddenly the police couldn\\'t watch all your actions at will. Things\\n would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely\\n private.\\n \\n Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have\\n video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. \"After all\", they\\n said, \"with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing\\n video cameras doesn\\'t mean that the police get any new capability --\\n they are just keeping the old one.\"\\n \\n A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the\\n lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the\\n mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that\\n Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was\\n expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it\\n had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to\\n solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its\\n expedience. Indeed, \"why have warrants at all\", he asked, \"if we are\\n interested only in expedience?\"\\n \\n A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She\\n noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating\\n should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,\\n and the law was passed.\\n \\n Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths\\n while speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading\\n their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the\\n police said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their\\n lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never\\n before been allowed to listen in on people\\'s homes, but Dorothy\\n Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of\\n covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and\\n mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused\\n of being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one\\n wanted to interfere in people\\'s rights to wear what they liked, so a\\n compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with\\n microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man\\n lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old\\n lip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were\\n installed everwhere.\\n \\n However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent\\n citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of\\n them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not\\n understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at\\n all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that\\n they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. \"After all\",\\n Dorothy Quisling pointed out, \"they might be using the opportunity to\\n speak in private to mask terrorist activities!\"  Terrorism struck\\n terror into everyone\\'s hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of\\n this new law.\\n \\n Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all\\n of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which\\n all Ruritanians were proud. \"Why\", he asked, \"are we obligated to\\n sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police\\n easier? There isn\\'t any real evidence that this makes any big dent in\\n crime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!\"\\n \\n However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law\\n required, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a\\n microphone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived\\n and took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture\\n was, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been\\n recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene\\n thoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the\\n major problems of the new age of plenty and joy.\\n \\n --\\n Perry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n --\\n Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Message-digest algorithms\\n have many applications, including digital signatures and message\\n authentication.\\n \\n RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\n Rivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\n Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\n second.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\n secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\n to a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\n operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\n one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n \\n Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\n a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\n internal compression function, which maps\\n a 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n 128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\n state. They show how to find a message block $x$\\n and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\n output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\n exploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\n a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\n would expect.\\n \\n Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\n MD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\n pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\n pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\n collision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\n always involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n $f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\n message blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\n generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\n the same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\n extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\n special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n \\n It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\n Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\n MD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\n and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\n course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\n other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\n such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n \\n \\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n \\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n \\n \\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\n Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n \\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n \\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n \\\\newblock Preprint.\\n \\n \\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\n R.L.

The system may\\n not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\\n it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\\n suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\\n from escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal\\'s\\n coercing or colluding use of some other person\\'s Clipper phone.\\n \\n I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\\n The original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\\n and illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\\n harmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\\n \\n Assumptions:\\n \\n   1.  Clipper is made available.\\n \\n   2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\\n       (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\\n       also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\\n       spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\\n       wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\\n       detection a cause for further action.\\n \\n   3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\\n       associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\\n       some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and\\n       the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\\n       An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\\n       red flag.\\n \\n   4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\\n       will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\\n       and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones.\\n \\n   5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\\n       entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\\n       cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\\n       they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\\n       legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\\n       wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\\n       each one has a unique unit key.\\n \\n   6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\\n       are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\\n       they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\\n       detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\\n       on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\\n       a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\\n       immediate suspicion.\\n \\n   7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\\n       and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\\n \\n By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\\n phone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s\\n association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\\n around, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\\n associated with someone else.\\n \\n A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\\n communications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\\n or steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from\\n reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\\n communications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\\n but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\\n or abandoning the phone before T elapses.\\n \\n It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\\n phone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone\\n else\\'s bill, and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion.\\n \\n This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\\n and collusion.\\n \\n Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\\n a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\\n a car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\\n from someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\\n arise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\\n criminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\\n who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\\n communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\\n The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\\n that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\\n freshly coerced phones.\\n \\n There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\\n wealthy criminals, and ignorant or don\\'t-care patsies who need money,\\n and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\\n phone service for someone else\\'s use.\\n \\n Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\\n Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\\n cellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\\n their stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must\\n first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\\n have its keys obtained from escrow.\\n \\n Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\\n conceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\\n mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\\n can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\\n in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\\n which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\\n pieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\\n \\n Whereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\\n would stand out, a criminal\\'s use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\\n medium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\\n recordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\\n chip is fractured.\\n \\n If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\\n the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he\\'ll be\\n using someone else\\'s phone), but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against\\n whatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\\n able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\\n identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\\n \\n The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\\n they were before Clipper came along.\\n \\n I therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\\n \\n   1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\\n       aggressive or dishonest government.\\n \\n   2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\\n       criminal threat to the honest public.\\n \\n   3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\\n       hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\\n       ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\\n       and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\\n \\n   4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\\n       are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\\n       than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\\n       escrow is claimed to help against.\\n \\n   5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\\n       of \"illegal\" cipher use.

It's much\\n stronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of\\n 160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first\\n standardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same\\n strength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less\\n the beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of\\n very high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit\\n that description.\\n \\n Why n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I\\n have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're\\n constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.\\n A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change\\n -- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit\\n patterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i\\n values are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming\\n distance.\\n \\n In any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i\\n from the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don't\\n need to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In\\n theory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)\\n \\n The real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed\\n to a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is\\n *much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the\\n EFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number\\n generator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you\\n come back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that\\n well?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been\\n changed out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the\\n presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards\\n selecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it\\n again, but that's hard.\\n \\n Consider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own\\n floppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a\\n lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.\\n (Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they're\\n a lot harder.)\\n \\n There are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the\\n architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,\\n with one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA and\\n NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that\\n their real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under\\n certain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of\\n abuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a\\n programming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be\\n loaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't\\n claim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning\\n sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions\\n section of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the\\n scheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with\\n implementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and\\n due process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this\\n question, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both\\n strong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap\\n *some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to\\n challenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I\\n present below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical\\n aspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just because\\n something can be done, it should be.)\\n \\n The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually\\n going to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't\\n mean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will\\n substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the\\n shipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that\\n the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,\\n guys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have\\n bought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no\\n answer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of\\n answering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer\\n to the final question, below.\\n \\n The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good\\n idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.\\n I think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil\\n libertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great\\n length on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy\\n to repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some\\n laws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of\\n individuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our\\n system -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has\\n certainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in\\n other cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but\\n again, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians\\n to answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the\\n rest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those\\n who give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more\\n distant from.)\\n \\n \\n \\t\\t--Steve Bellovin\\n\",\n",

I\\'ll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it\\'s a\\n bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the\\n protocol that\\'s followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a\\n wiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption\\n and the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is\\n sent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The\\n F-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the\\n encrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.

The\\n cops and the FBI together can\\'t cheat, since they don\\'t have U.  (I\\n regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the\\n system.  It\\'s to prevent this that I modified Alvarez\\'s scheme.)  The\\n escrow agents can\\'t read the conversation, since they don\\'t have it;\\n all they have is N and U[K].

Then as part of the initial connection,\\n a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate\\n that they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q\\n and sends E[Q; F].

Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so\\n it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential\\n numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial\\n numbers of subsequent challenges.

Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own\\n proprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that\\n they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.\\n \\n What's wrong with this picture?

Brown\\n Secretary\\n Department of Commerce\\n 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\\n Washington, DC 20236\\n \\n Dear Secretary Brown:\\n \\n    As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \\n and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \\n a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \\n Administration\\'s endorsement of an electronic encryption \\n standard, based upon \"clipper chip\" technology, have raised a \\n number of related issues.  The international competitiveness \\n of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \\n a key factor that the government should consider when \\n addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \\n nation moves forward in developing the national \\n communications and information infrastructure, security of \\n telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \\n increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \\n users.\\n \\n    The \"hacker\" community can compromise the integrity of \\n telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \\n network.  The people and businesses that use the nation\\'s \\n telecommunications network and the personal computers linked \\n through it increasingly are demanding that information be \\n protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\\n \\n    I am concerned that the Administration\\'s plan may mean \\n that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \\n would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \\n government customers, and another for private, commercial \\n users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \\n inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \\n to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee\\'s analysis \\n of this issue, please respond to the following questions:\\n \\n 1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \\n Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \\n or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \\n nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \\n plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \\n such experts will be chosen.\\n \\n 2. Under the Administration\\'s plan, what entities will be the \\n holders of the \"keys\" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \\n procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \\n designate such key holders?\\n \\n 3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \\n Administration contain a \"trap door\" or \"back door,\" which \\n could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \\n crack the code?\\n \\n 4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \\n for communications will require new techniques and additional \\n equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \\n advancement of telecommunications technology?\\n \\n 5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \\n on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \\n consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \\n in their equipment?\\n \\n 6. What is the Commerce Department\\'s assessment of the \\n competitive impact of the Administration\\'s endorsement of the \\n \"clipper chip\" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \\n telecommunications hardware and software products?\\n \\n    I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\\n of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \\n questions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \\n Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\\n \\n Sincerely,\\n \\n Edward J.

So far any references I have seen\\n have been weasel-words (\"more plans in the future, etc\"), but nothing\\n that could be taken as a \"NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)\".  I\\n have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has\\n language that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard\\n all systems \\'unapproved\\' for public use, like strong cryptosystems\\n not trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys\\n which one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by\\n folks with \\'special\\' connections, or government agencies) as either\\n \\'terrorist tools\\' or \\'drug dealers tools\\'.

For example, a crowbar, hammers,\\n screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as \\'burglar tools\\' pretty much\\n at the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\\n possessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\\n use of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no \\'legitimate need\\'\\n (gov\\'t definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\\n using them, might find themselves in possession of \\'terrorist tools\\'.\\n In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\\n sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed\\'s opinion) strong\\n security, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\\n not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\\n A personal desire for \\'privacy\\' most certainly will not be regarded as\\n a \\'legitimate NEED\\': \\n \"Why do you want such strong security, especially from \\'legitimate law\\n enforcement\\'? An individual with \\'legitimate\\' endeavors would not be so\\n concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal\\n secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning\\n to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...

(mega \\':-(\\'s)\\n \\n One asking about a \\'right\\' to privacy will probably get a response that\\n there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an\\n argument used in the abortion debate):  \"You do NOT have a right to have\\n security that \\'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break\\'\" (as suggested\\n in the Clipper Press Release).\\n \\n This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.

       " '\\n Sorry, my news reader doesn\\'t seem to know how to copy a subject header.\\n This tracks the thread \"why people don\\'t need strong crypto.....\"\\n \\n The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building\\n nuclear devices.  While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a \\n security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.\\n He found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the\\n local engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent him\\n all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in\\n the article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local\\n underground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been\\n precensored by the feds, that\\'s what this was all about) so the judge\\n declared the case moot.\\n \\n The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From my\\n discussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other\\n times has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people\\n simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.\\n \\n For all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for\\n declaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was\\n working on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works\\n and I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough\\n to classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from\\n Canada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping\\n cross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed\\n to present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an\\n open journal without problems.\\n \\n When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever\\n they want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let\\n themselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can\\'t tell the difference\\n between a joke and the real thing (like \"ranch appocolypse\" for the Waco\\n massacre) don\\'t count on them to help spread the word about their loss\\n of freedom.

The redundancy hereby introduced \\n can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy \\n replaced the L.E. block by random data. \\n \\n And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption \\n of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must \\n be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. \\n \\n For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing \\n a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding \\n it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies \\n of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption \\n algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the \\n receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and \\n it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting \\n faulty plaintext, you know -- it\\'s just like a checksum for your own \\n safety ;-(. \\n \\n The `monitoring agencies\\' won\\'t have the famous black box which is needed \\n for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents \\n them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the \\n serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks \\n within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as \\n they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.\\n \\n So don\\'t anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the \\n tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks \\n than those suggested above. Of course it\\'s absolutely crucial that the \\n algorithms (and protocols) remain secret.

Look at the \\'wealth\\' of material on the typical newsstand.\\n Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with\\n the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media\\n in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and\\n such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).

There seems\\n to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of\\n understanding major issues so the media doesn\\'t bother to inform them\\n (as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret\\n events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good\\n at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information\\n about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be\\n clarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had\\n I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,\\n let alone Internet access?\\n \\n For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.\\n Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not\\n have TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,\\n so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is\\n the way things are.  People aren\\'t upset about things when they aren\\'t\\n TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the\\n problem.\\n \\n And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service\\n (bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political\\n connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if\\n any rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their\\n polticial or financial gain.

Address all letters to his address, given at the end\\n of this document.\\n      -- Russell\\n \\n   FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\\n                      TECHNOLOGY\\n \\n   Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\\n \\n \\n      You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\\n technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\\n cles.  We tend to think of Orwell\\'s 1984, or Terry Gilliam\\'s\\n Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin\\'s\\n slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\\n phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\\n his \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\\n a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\\n sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\\n a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\\n longings if it beeps.\\n \\n      But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\\n were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\\n clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\\n eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\\n Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\\n evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\\n \\n      In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\\n ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\\n those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\\n the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\\n not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\\n merit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\\n tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\\n scribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\\n \\n      One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\\n over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\\n crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\\n and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\\n that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\\n the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\\n get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\\n formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\\n elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\\n achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\\n could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\\n arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\\n get.)\\n \\n      Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\\n likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\\n soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\\n plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\\n not only against one another, but against their governmental\\n masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\\n piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\\n medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\\n Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\\n tively, for its unlawful possession.\\n \\n      Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\\n like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\\n handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\\n machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\\n and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\\n called \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\\n in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\\n against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\\n ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\\n repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\\n horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\\n captured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\\n flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\\n true one.\\n \\n      Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\\n (with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\\n alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\\n such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one\\'s\\n own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\\n change   information   over   an   insecure   communications\\n channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\\n skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\\n met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\\n puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\\n X-MP  can\\'t  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\\n be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\\n cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\\n Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\\n will  have  totally demolished government\\'s control over in-\\n formation transfer.\\n \\n      I\\'d like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\\n ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\\n called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\\n who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\\n that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\\n large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\\n two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\\n tremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\\n digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\\n eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\\n computer now in existence.\\n \\n      The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\\n uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\\n tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\\n (q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\\n other factor  y.\\n \\n      Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\\n into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\\n A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\\n is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\\n integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\\n decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\\n (modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\\n yield the original number started with.\\n \\n      What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\\n it  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\\n openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\\n keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\\n an encrypted message, namely\\n                        x\\n                      a    (mod pq)  ,\\n but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\\n what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\\n result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\\n keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\\n each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\\n change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\\n disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\\n the secrecy of his own  y.\\n \\n      Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\\n ital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\\n a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\\n I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\\n your pq)  and send that.\\n \\n     However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\\n raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\\n pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\\n send this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\\n message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\\n then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\\n (mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\\n ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\\n could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\\n y).\\n \\n      And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\\n day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\\n personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\\n American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\\n puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\\n fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\\n interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\\n cisely these students who one generation hence will be going\\n head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\\n Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\\n teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\\n ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\\n computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\\n machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\\n text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\\n weren\\'t threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\\n copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\\n unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\\n cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\\n copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\\n sively than machine guns are in the United States.)\\n \\n      Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\\n sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\\n them  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\\n should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\\n cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don\\'t make the sale, there\\n will certainly be some other nation willing to.\\n \\n      For my part, I\\'m ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\\n position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\\n if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn\\'t\\n work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\\n Moscow in the middle of the night.

I confess that this\\n is not a position that has gained much support among members\\n of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\\n ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus\\'s characters, we\\n are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\\n particular  goal may not look anything like what most people\\n would consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\\n world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\\n ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\\n the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\\n the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\\n missiles aimed at Moscow.\\n \\n      But  there\\'s  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\\n suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\\n simply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what\\'s not\\n immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\\n killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\\n \\n     When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\\n tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\\n functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\\n hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\\n gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\\n patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\\n and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\\n while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\\n up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\\n sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\\n crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\\n the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\\n potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\\n ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\\n risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\\n was called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\\n into  action.    For the first time in American history, the\\n speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\\n came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\\n oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\\n can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\\n sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\\n grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\\n government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\\n lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\\n to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\\n what  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\\n war--the government against its own people?\"\\n \\n      And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\\n ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\\n court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\\n cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\\n compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\\n be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\\n \\n      So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\\n hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\\n certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\\n stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\\n exists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\\n nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\\n dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\\n warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\\n the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\\n all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\\n in the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\\n sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\\n whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\\n choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\\n ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\\n down to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\\n on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\\n a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\\n of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life\\'s labor.\\n \\n      So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\\n some  sort  if  we\\'re ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\\n ously  can\\'t  use  the  altruists\\'  \"other-directedness\"  of\\n \"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\\n a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\\n Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\\n is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today\\'s culture.\\n If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\\n \"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\\n to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\\n working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\\n to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\\n peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\\n libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\\n and say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\\n noble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\\n give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\\n selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\\n children are dead) maybe your children\\'s children will actu-\\n ally  live under egoism\"--you\\'d all think I\\'d gone mad.  And\\n of course you\\'d be right.  Because the point I\\'m  trying  to\\n make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\\n when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\\n profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\\n then.\\n \\n      While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\\n tical  action, I don\\'t believe that it is the only, nor even\\n necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\\n freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\\n investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\\n ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\\n forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who\\'s in-\\n terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\\n unilaterally.\\n \\n      There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\\n the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\\n ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\\n the saying, you might well feel that you\\'ve heard  it  often\\n enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\\n and moreover, that maybe you\\'re even tired of hearing it.  I\\n shall therefore repeat it now:\\n \\n      If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\\n for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\\n for a lifetime.\\n \\n      Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\\n a  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\\n genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\\n how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\\n And of course this is true, if only because the next time he\\n is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\\n able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\\n to fish, he is completely self sufficient.\\n \\n      But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\\n content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\\n glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\\n again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\\n slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\\n tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\\n beggars as we may encounter.\\n \\n      But consider:\\n \\n      Suppose this Eskimo doesn\\'t know how to  fish,  but  he\\n does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\\n have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\\n because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\\n they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\\n the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\\n fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\\n thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\\n categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\\n that  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\\n idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\\n \"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\\n scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\\n thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\\n ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\\n (rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\\n game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\\n diminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\\n thermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\\n bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that\\'s\\n anarchy!\\n \\n      Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\\n Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\\n nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\\n contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\\n tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\\n even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people\\'s\\n health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\\n adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens\\' bodies are thought\\n to be government property, and therefore it is the  function\\n of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\\n ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\\n ously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\\n to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\\n all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\\n not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\\n thought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\\n case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\\n lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\\n his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\\n session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\\n \\n      Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\\n oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\\n affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\\n ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\\n ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\\n this tyrant\\'s goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\\n the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\\n \"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\\n oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\\n haps even other motives.)\\n \\n      But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\\n your \"cause,\" you\\'re not about to mount a military campaign,\\n or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\\n However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\\n formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\\n hundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\\n the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\\n smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\\n hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\\n geted government, like present-day America, at least permits\\n open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\\n stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\\n attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\\n you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\\n your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\\n your mythical Eskimo\\'s public-key parameters.  But as far as\\n increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\\n nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\\n re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\\n have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\\n eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\\n cided.  Recall Harry Browne\\'s dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\\n Unfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\\n inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\\n sion is necessary to its fulfilment.\\n \\n      If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\\n been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\\n Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\\n Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\\n by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\\n Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\\n vasive, and not nearly so bloody.\\n \\n      And  that\\'s  where  I\\'m  trying  to  take The LiberTech\\n Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\\n slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\\n work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\\n freedom for ourselves.\\n \\n      But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\\n present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\\n wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\\n ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\\n ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\\n when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\\n commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\\n fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\\n This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\\n it does indicate how government thinks.\\n \\n      Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\\n pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\\n who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\\n railroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\\n the sovereign government of the United States of America  at\\n that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\\n as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\\n larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\\n ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\\n alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\\n ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\\n for his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\\n when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\\n drug.\\n \\n      So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\\n conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\\n perfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\\n participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\\n matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\\n such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\\n tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\\n processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\\n or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\\n censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\\n needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\\n self.\\n \\n      So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\\n despair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\\n this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\\n before  I\\'ll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\\n goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\\n that  such  is not the case.

TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the \\n standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect \\n that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be \\n exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic \\n field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.\\n \\n Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the \\n printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the \\n crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some \\n intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential \\n sources of leaked information.\\n \\n Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection \\n becomes an important security hazard.\\n \\n In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, \\n particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST \\n threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the \\n 'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' \\n for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to \\n approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified.

Your original\\n question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the\\n message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,\\n and I don\\'t know the answer. However, I would propose the following\\n for discussion.\\n \\n Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to\\n share, which Eve doesn\\'t know. She finds them out (effectively) by\\n knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they\\n CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to\\n be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not\\n know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,\\n she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.\\n \\n What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.\\n (Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn\\'t\\n have exactly the same effect).\\n \\n Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC\\n computed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):\\n   1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S\\n   2. break C2 into n-bit chunks\\n   3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)\\n   4. for i in each chunk sequentially\\n        set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]\\n \\n At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.\\n \\n (Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the\\n plaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in\\n the same manner.)\\n \\n NLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\\n an \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\\n coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\\n diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\\n \"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC\\'s are highly\\n efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\\n which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\\n reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\\n efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\\n resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\\n for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\\n screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\\n from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\\n Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\\n and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\\n to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\\n gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\\n telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\\n \\n GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\\n TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!\\n \\n If it had been up to Edison, we\\'d still be in the 19th century.\\n (flame me at your own peril. I\\'m very good at putting edison down).\\n \\n ----\\n  ET   \"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes\".\\n ----\\n',\n",
